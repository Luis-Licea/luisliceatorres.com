# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize the site. If you look in the HTML files, you
# will see them accessed via {{ site.author.title }}, {{ site.author.email }},
# and so on. You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be
# accessible in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
