Do not use my recipes; my cooking sucks and is very plain; these recipes are
just personal notes.

## Baked, sliced sweet potato

Ingredients:

- 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes
- 1 tbs spoon extra virgin oil
- 5g salt

Slice the sweet potatoes into circles.
Mix the oil and the salt in a small container.
Cover each potato slice with a thin salt-oil layer.
Make the slices stand straight on a ceramic plate, making small cuts as needed.
Bake for 40 minutes at 450°F, which is below the extra virgin olive oil smoke point.

## Baked sweet potato

Ingredients:

- 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes

Place the unpeeled sweet potatoes on a ceramic plate. 
Bake for 40 minutes at 450°F until the skin detaches and the molten sugars start
seeping.

This method is so lazy. Can it even be called cooking? :joy_cat:

## Beans

Ingredients:

- 400g beans
- 1,200g water
- 12g sea salt

Measure the beans, check them for stones, wash them to remove dirt, then add
them in pressure cooker. Add the water and the salt. Set the pressure cooker
time to 40 minutes at high pressure. Different beans have different hardness, so
less time may be needed so they do not turn out mushy.

## Split Pea soup

Ingredients:

- 2 carrots
- 2 celery stalks
- 1 large onion
- 4 garlic gloves
- 2 (1lb) cups split peas
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground tumeric (optional)
- 6 (3.1lb) cups water or veggie broth
- 11g salt
- pepper
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley

Cook everything for 15 minutes on high pressure in a pressure cooker. The peas
will turn out mushy like baby food.
