- Music is commonly written in the 4/4 time signature and commonly structured in
  sets of 8 beats.
- The 4/4 time signature means 4 quarter notes per bar. How long is a quarter
  note? In this case it is one beat long, but that is not the case for other
  time signatures. The length of the beat is defined by the beats per minute
  (BPM) in a song.

  For example, if a song is fast and has 120 beats per second, then there are
  two beats per minute. In other words, counting 8 beats will take 4 seconds.

- You can approximate the beats per minute in a song by counting 8 beats and
  seeing how many seconds it takes. If you started counting when the music
  player was at 2min 15 sec and you finished counting when it was at 2min 20
  sec, then 8 beats took 5 seconds. This means the song is 96 BPM.

  If it takes 5 seconds to count 8 beats, then you are listening to a mid-tempo
  song with \\(((8 beats / 5 seconds) \* 60 seconds / 1 minute) = 96\\) beats
  per minute.

  If it takes 3 seconds to count 8 beats, then you are listing to a really fast,
  non-danceable song of \\(((8 beats / 3 seconds) \* 60 seconds / 1 minute) =
  160\\) beats per minute.

- West Coast Swing competitions usually feature songs around 100 beats per
  minute, so that means songs between 80 to 120 beats per minute are good for
  social dancing.
- A major phrase is 32 beats. A minor phrase is 16 beats (usually) or 8 beats
  (rarely). Songs are usually structured in sets of minor and major phrases.
- Contemporary music is written in 8 bar phrases, and each bar has 4 beats. This
  means there are 32 beats in a phrase. In Blues each phrase is 12 bars, so
  there are 48 beats in each phrase.
- All ballroom dances except Waltz are written in 4/4 time and can be danced
  using 8 beat patterns:
  - Bachata: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Chacha: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Polka: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Two Step: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Salsa: 8-beat patterns
  - West Coast Swing: primarily 6- and 8-beat patterns, with 10- and 12-beat
    patterns requiring a rock-and-go
  - Waltz is written in 3/4 time signature and has 6-beat patterns

## Musicality exercises

Musicality is hard. I suspect it will take anywhere from 3 months to 2 years to
learn.

### Counting straight 8's

1. Count straight 8s up to 12 times. Repeat this exercise at least 3 times
   without mistakes.
2. Count straight 8s up to 12 times in sync with music. Repeat this exercise at
   least 3 times without mistakes.
3. Count straight 8s up to 12 times while doing whips. You may get unbearably
   dizzy. Repeat this exercise at least 3 times without mistakes.
4. Same as 3, but doing sugar pushes only.
5. Same as 3, but doing left-side passes only.
6. Same as 3, but doing right-side passes only.
7. Same as 3, but doing a sequence of 4 6-beat patterns and 1 8-beat pattern to
   add up to 32 beats.
8. Count straight 8s in sync with music for an entire song. Reset the count
   after each major phrase change. Repeat this exercise 3 times.
9. Same as 8, but doing whips only.
10. Same as 8, but doing sugar pushes only.
11. Same as 8, but doing left-side passes only.
12. Same as 8, but doing right-side passes only.
13. Same as 8, but doing a sequence of 4 6-beat patterns and 1 8-beat pattern.
14. To develop your phrase change intuition, jump to random points in a song and
    count the beats leading up to a major phrase change at least one third of
    the time.
15. Same as 14, but while dancing any 6- and 8-beat patterns required to hit the
    phrase change.
16. Listen to a song and pay attention to the chord progression. Detect the
    major phase change before it happens without doing any counting.
17. Now do 14, 15, and 16 all simultaneously. If you can manage to do this, you
    are a musicality professional.

These exercises miss a few things, like how to gracefully get on beat if dancing
off-beat by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 beats.

You don't have to hit all the phrase changes in the song. Aim for 1, then 2,
then 3, then all of them for a specific song you are familiar with.

Rules: once the song starts and you make your first move, you cannot bail out
and stop dancing. Doesn't matter how fast, how slow, how tired, how sloppy, how
confused you may be.

Note: I count beats in sets of 8 so I can do quick math on the total number of
beats I have danced. The way I count beats in a song is as follows:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **1** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **2** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **3** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **..**

### Accentuating the 1

Dance your basic patterns while counting straight 8s. Accentuate the 1 by any
means necessary. This may mean a slide on 1, a back drop on 3, or a side check
or sweep on 5. You can accentuate the 1 by accentuating the 3&4 compression on a
sugar tuck. You may also sweep or point your free arm or head. Accentuations
will all fall on 1, 3, or 5 while counting straight 8s to 6-beat patterns.

**1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 ...

#### Sugar push with accents

- on 1: do a [hitch] step or [level change]
- on 3: do a back drop while angling your body leftwards or a [brush] backwards
- on 5: do a [right side-check] side-check or a [clockwise sweep]

### Counting straight 2's

Zach told me that counting straight 8's takes too much mental bandwidth, so he
only counts 1, 2 or 1&2 for triple steps. He is able to feel the music
progression to avoid having to count straight 8's to hit the phrase changes.
Jennifer also counts straight 2's.

The benefit of counting straight 2's is that you do not need to know when the
phrase change will happen. You just get ready for it on every 2, or continue as
normal if you do not hear the phrase change. This may be the most useful for
songs that are completely unfamiliar. I wonder if it may be useful to use a
mixed approach, where one counts straight 2's until a phrase change, after which
counting straight 8's may become relevant again.

Counting straight 2's simplifies hitting phrase changes because you do not have
to know if the phrase change will happen on a 1, a 3, a 5, or a 7. The negative
part of this is that you may not be able to plan your patterns in advanced if
you only have 2 beats to prepare.

## Pattern count combinations

Many popular songs are composed such that each phrase is 32 beats. The leader
can use this knowledge to sequence his/her patterns such that they add up to 32
beats, leading to sequences that consistently end on a phrase change.

If you start dancing at the beginning of a phrase change, then you must sequence
your patterns to add up to 32. If started late by two steps, then you sequence
must last 30 beats, etc.

The equations below split up the total number of beats into chunks that can be
translated into specific patterns. For example, the equation \\(32=6+6+6+6+8\\)
could be translated into \\(4\\) basic patterns and \\(1\\) whip.

I am not sure whether 4-beat or 2-beat patterns exist in West Coast Swing. There
are starter steps that are 4-beats long, but they are only used to start the
dance. Also, 6-beat and 8-beat patterns may be lengthened via styling to make
them 2 beats longer, but I have never heard of a standalone 2-beat pattern.

Some ways to lengthen a pattern by 2 beats are:

- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with a 4-beat, slow, and smooth sweep
- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with 4 small steps, 1-beat each
- Split the 6-beat or the 8-beat pattern into 2-beat increments, and repeat any
  2-beat increment. For example, a 6-beat pattern can be split into 2-beat
  increment like walk-walk triple-step triple-step, and then lengthened by
  2-beats by adding another walk-walk at the beginning or another triple-step
  any time after the initial walk-walk. It is a subtle form of copy-and-paste.
