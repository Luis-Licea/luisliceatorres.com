Poetry
: A confusing conglomeration of words that lacks meaning, yet achieves to cause a sensation of awe – especially in women – because it rhymes and/or exaggerates some aspect of life. A boring pastime only romanticists and sentimentalists can derive enjoyment from.


Epic
: A poem narrating the story of a historical hero and his great deeds. For example, the poem Beowulf, which is definitely the most **epic** poem you will ever find.

Usage note: Here at *Luis’ Comprehensive Dictionary*, we believe that the meaning of the word “epic” has been changed by common usage and now resembles in meaning the word “legendary,” as used above.

Meter
: A complicated set of stressed and unstressed syllables that together form the basic unit of poetic rhythm. These rhythms are known as feet; no wonder poetry stinks. 

Comitatus
: Akin to Concomitant; a mutually beneficial practice in which two or more individuals are loyal to each other. This allegiance is proved by protecting others or rewarding those who have protected you. “I watch your back, you watch mine” philosophy. It is really a shame that Comitatus has died and given way to individualism. Unfortunately, loyalty and comradely died with it; we no longer have men and warriors, but artists, writers, sculptors, and singers. Yuck.

Heroic Ideal
: The idea that one’s transcendence in history depends upon one’s acts of honor, bravery, and strength accomplished while being alive. This includes, but is not limited to, the killing of demons, dragons, and nefarious mothers.

It is a hard way of life that only strong and honest men can take, but sadly, the ideal has been forsaken and replaced with “reasoning.” These poor weaklings talk about having more brain, but what they need is more BRAWN!
