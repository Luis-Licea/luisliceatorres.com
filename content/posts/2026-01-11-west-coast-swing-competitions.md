## Competition music

West Coast Swing competitions usually feature pop (high energy, staccato),
contemporary (ooey-gooey, legato, smooth), and blues (bouncy) songs around 100
beats per minute.

## Competition tips

If your face is stone cold without making eye contact, you will be perceived as
less confident, less sure of yourself, or hiding something, meaning you will be
graded more critically. Your smile is part of how your dance is perceived.
Having a stone-cold face also makes your partner feel more critical of your
dance and her own dance. It is an overall unpleasant experience.

Smiling will let the judges be more forgiving of your mistakes. Smile, look at
your partner, and enjoy every moment.

Dancing competitively is a visual sport, so judges can only judge what they see
during your performance. Judges are not supposed to use previous knowledge of
your dancing even if they dance with you before competing.

There are 4 types of West Coast Swing competitions.

## Jack & Jill

Jack & Jill competitions involve dancing with people and music picked at random.
You do not know what music will play or with whom you will dance.

There are three divisions:

- Leader Jack & Jill: For those who want to compete in the leader role.
- Follower Jack & Jill: For those who want to compete in the follower role.
- All American: You get to dance with people of every division: Newcomer,
  novice, intermediate, masters, advanced, and all star.

The only two divisions that will give you WSDC competitor points are Leader Jack
& Jill and Follower Jack & Jill divisions.

### Tips

In Jack-and-Jill prelims and semi-finals, the leader and the follow are judged
individually. Because the judge only looks at you for 8 seconds, your dance must
be extremely busy, full of quality motion. Be repetitive because you will only
be judged a few seconds and you do not know when that will be. In other words,
do basics, but style them as much as possible without affecting the partnership
or the footwork. Everything below the knees is WCS, and anything above is for
you to style. Amplify and style often. Do not wait for the anchor step to style.
Be selfish, be flashy. It is upon the partner to amplify and style to get to
your level. Do not try to be less flashy to try to avoid creating an imbalance;
meet your parter where she is if she is being flashy rather than dumbing down
the dance. That's not what Jack and Jill is about; you are being judged
individually so do your best independently of your partner. Start moving soon.
Do not spend too much time to start the dance. Waiting 16 beats is definitely
too much.

In newcomer division, doing clean basics may win, but in novice it will not. In
novice division you must have clean basics and lots of variety in your movement.
If you see advanced followers, you will see their lats and backs are constantly
rippling.

A straight spine has no styling. Quality motion comes from engaging the upper
body, specially the lats, and improving footwork. Quality of motion is the most
important in competitions. Do not confuse movement across the dance floor with
motion within your own body. Quality motion, not movement, is more effective for
looking good when swing dancing in general.

In the finals context, the criteria changes. Rather than focusing on quality of
movement and variety, the focus is on connection and partnership.

## Strictly Swing

You choose your partner, but not the song.

### Tips

Every dance is judged like it is a final, meaning that the leader and follow are
judged as a couple.
