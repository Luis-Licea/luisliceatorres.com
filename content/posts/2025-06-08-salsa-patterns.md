I have taken Salsa classes at the [Gilruth Center], with [Salsa Eddy], and at
[The Palladium], but I consider myself very much a beginner. Nearly all salsa
classes and social dances take place in Houston, so my unwillingness to
regularly drive to Houston has slowed down my progress.

An acquaintance named Billy showed me some Cali (Colombian) salsa patterns, and
I was blown away by them. The patterns seemed mostly like basic salsa patterns,
but contained shuffle-dance elements sprinkled throughout.

Luckily, I was able to find some video tutorials online for [Cali salsa].
