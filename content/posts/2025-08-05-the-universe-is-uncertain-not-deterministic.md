Some people believe that the universe is deterministic, but this is not the case
because we cannot simultaneously measure the velocity and location of quantum
objects like photons. This is known as the
[Uncertainty Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT7xJ0tjB4A). Maybe the
reason why instruments with perfect precision cannot exist in the first place is
because uncertainty is part of the universe. The randomness introduced by
measurements means that the universe is not deterministic. Additionally, there
is no equation that can take into account every variable in the universe. Even
if a hypothetical supercomputer existed and it were given near-infinite
resources, it would not be able to simulate every event in the universe because
the computer being part of the universe would also have to simulate itself
recursively an infinite number of times. In any case, any entity capable of
developing instruments with perfect precision, designing equations that account
for every event in the universe, or building super computers with near-infinite
resources to simulate the entire universe could be called God-like.

The universe cannot be simulated in its entirety due to lack of computational
resources, due to lack of deterministic equations, and due to not knowing all
the variables needed to plug into these hypothetical equations. For example, how
can you simulate the moon orbiting around the earth if you do not know the exact
distance between the moon and the earth? The simulation can only approximate
reality because the measurement can only approximate reality.

Also, a perfect simulation is not possible if any information has been lost
forever. For example, we do not know what happened before the big bang, so it is
impossible to predict anything that could have existed before the big bang, so
for practical purposes it can be said that nothing existed before the big bang.

Some information is lost forever and no mathematical formula or simulation can
ever be used to regain the lost information. This is a very sad realization
because most actions, words, and thoughts have not been recorded, meaning that
for practical purposes it is like they never existed.

<!--
We will never be able to use our mathematical formulas to determine what
happened in the past. My life is not perfect, but it is good. I hope it could be
recorded and stored forever, even if it only existed in God's mind. However,
recording everything for eternity may be a selfish request due to the fact that
all life forms suffer. There is a lot of suffering in the world and maybe in the
universe in general. It may not be fair to immortalize the suffering of others
for the sake of the few of us who wish our memories were immortalized.
