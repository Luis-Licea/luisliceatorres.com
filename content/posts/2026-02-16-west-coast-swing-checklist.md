- Smile
- count down beats (to hit 1's, phrase changes)
- Break wrists so thumbs line up along radius bone.
- Do full weight changes by settling slightly on hips:
  - To slow down weight transfer, stand with feet apart at shoulder width.
  - Do not shift feet on even beets.
  - Do drop steps on 3 of sugar push and side passes.
- Keep elbows bent so they stay at or behind rib cage, not past it.
- angling body at 2:00 for effecting stretching when anchoring before squaring
  up.
  - Stretch on the 7 of the &1 of a new pattern.
- Practice choreography.
- Practice engaging lats.
- Interpret the lyrics.
- Interpret the instruments (bouncy, smooth, or detached beats).
- Create opposition and twist spine on every step by contracting latissimus
  dorsi laterally on every step or triple step (as opposed to contracting the
  both side of the lat on a triple step). Contract the lat that is opposite to
  the free leg.
  - A side wave will not work because it requires bending the knees or changing
    levels, which will not work well with side passes or whips.

## Sugar push

Using arms and left leg as a spring during a sugar push. Do not stop follower
immediately on 3. Catch on 2 and slowly absorb on 3. Be a pillow, not a wall. On
1, when squaring up from the stretch, speed up follower and catch her right hand
on 2, then absorb the momentum.
