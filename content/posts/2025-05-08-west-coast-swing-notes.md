I have been going to the [Bay Area Whip Dance Club] for a few months. Classes
are divided in levels and instructors rotate so they can teach different levels.
So far our instructor for level 1 classes has been [Chuck Anders]. He knows how
to dance Salsa, Bachata, Tango, Polka, Waltz, Rumba, Two Step, West Coast Swing,
and East Coast Swing. If I remember correctly, he said he began dancing when he
was about 14 years old. Luckily Chuck was also my instructor for level 2. I am
repeating level 2. My current instructor is Ray.

## West Coast Swing elements

There are many elements in West Coast Swing dancing:

- Musicality: Are the dancers on beat, synchronized to the music? Are the
  dancers stopping on the breaks? Are the dancers accentuating the 1s in the
  music?
- Rock-and-go: are the dancers able to combine patterns without doing an anchor?
- Repetition: Are the dancers able to take a basic pattern, split it into
  increments, and repeat those increments?
- Tension and compression: Is the leader and the follower connected? Are they
  reacting to each other or dancing independently? Is the leader prepping
  correctly?

## General dance knowledge

- An inside turn is a left, counterclockwise turn
- An outside turn is a right, clockwise turn
- Collecting your feet means placing them right next to each other,
  ankle-to-ankle.
- Replacing your foot means taking it off the ground and placing it back on the
  same spot.

## Personal advice

This advice is not verbatim. It is paraphrased in the manner I understood it.

From Chuck Anders:

- Aim to have fun, stay safe, and dance every song.
- The most important thing that you can bring to a dance is a smile.
- Do not prepare twice because it confused the follower.
- Move up, down, left and right to use all the slot. It makes the dance look
  good.

From Rick Brunson:

- After finishing a pattern on step 6 or 8, do not rush immediately into step 1
  of the next pattern. There is a whole beat between step 8 and step 1 of the
  next pattern.
- When leading a whip, step back on 1 and pull straight back. Do not begin the
  J-hook prematurely.
- Tension should reach a maximum at the beginning of a pattern, then decrease,
  and then increase back again at the end of the pattern.
- When doing a whip, do not do a round motion, do an L motion. You are standing
  perpendicular to the follower up to 3& as you let the tension on the
  follower's back build up. On 4 you step straight across and slightly forward.
  On 5 rotate 0.5 turns clockwise on the ball of your left foot as you bring
  your right foot next to your left foot as if holding a quarter between your
  ankles. Both of your feet should be pointing at 3 o'clock as opposed to 6
  o'clock.

From Ray Trusty:

- A prep does not happen on step two, it happens between step 1 and 2, when the
  follower's left foot is floating and pulling on the arm would cause a rotation
  on the follower's right foot. In other words, it is 1-prep-2-3&4 as opposed to
  1-prep-3&4.
- Do not open up you arms when doing a sugar push. Imagine you are holding a
  piece of paper under each armpit and you do not want the pieces to fall. Only
  open up your arms is when doing a hustle whip to close the space between you
  and the follower.
- Even if you are doing the steps correctly, you must actively lead the follower
  and move the slot. Otherwise she looks good dancing around you while you look
  like a pole standing in the middle.

From Bob Wilder:

- Move your head and shoulders to indicate where you want the follower to go.
  For example, look over your left shoulder when doing a left-side pass and look
  over your right shoulder when doing a right-side pass.
- When leading a whip, on step 1 pull, on step 2 grip the follower's hand and
  post it so it does not move. Let the follower walk into the left hand so the
  momentum causes a clockwise rotation.
- During a sugar tuck, on step 4 keep your left elbow tucked in and relaxed, not
  floating. Imagine you are trying to hold a sheet of paper with your armpit.
- The follower should exert equal and opposite force as the leader to achieve
  good tension and compression.

  For example, if the leader pulls and slowly increases the force from 1lb to
  6lb, then the follower should slowly increase the force with which she pulls
  back to cancel out that force. This causes tension. If the leader pushes and
  slowly increases the force from 1lb to 6lb, then the follower should slowly
  increase the force with which she pushes back to cancel out that force. This
  causes compression. After about 6lb of force is reached, the follower has a
  clear indication to move into the direction she is being pulled or pushed
  into.

- A good frame consists of having your right hand on the follower's left
  shoulder blade and applying pressure, but an excellent frame requires the
  follower to actively push with her right hand into your left hand to provide
  some resistance. This allows the leader to use his left hand to move the
  follower to the back or to the right, and the right hand to move the follower
  to the front or to the left. This requires the follower to be pressed firmly
  between the left and right hands, which cannot be done without the follower's
  help.

From Damon D'Amico:

- Don't step into slot on 4 when doing a left-side pass or a right-side pass. By
  not walking into the slot you can perform steps 3&4 even if the follower has
  not finished stepping across the slot. If you step into the slot on 4, you may
  step on the follower. Also, if you step into the slot on 4, you will be forced
  to square up on the anchor step and you will be unaligned with the follower
  instead of being face-to-face.
- Don't square up on the anchor step or you will look like a nooby. Use angles.
- The slot is twice as wide as your body for the chain turn, it not a tight
  rope. Use the full width when turning, otherwise your feet will get crowded
  and unbalanced like you are walking on a tight rope.
- Step 3 on a [free spin] should be a back drop so that backwards your body
  movement causes the follower to rotate counter-clockwise.

From Jennifer:

- While leading a [left-side inside chain turn], a [right-side outside chain
  turn], a [sugar tuck pirouette], or any turn in general, you must use as few
  fingers as possible to lead follower throughout the rotation. You can use two
  fingers in chain turns, but you must use one finger for pirouettes. As
  Jennifer's instructor told her, this is the only time when a follower will be
  extremely happy to receive the middle finger.
- Engage your latissimus dorsi in an [open] position as opposed to using your
  biceps or forearms so there is a direct connection to your core.
- Tension and compression are not results of pulling and pushing with your arms,
  they are the results of standing or stepping on the heels of your feet and
  standing or stepping on the balls of your feet, respectively. If you stand on
  your heels there will be tension, and if you stand on your balls there will be
  compression.

From Rachel Moran:

- Imagine that you are trying to bring your armpits to the floor in an [open]
  position such that it puffs out your chest slightly. This should improve the
  connection to your core.
- Unlike salsa, WCS does not require you to dance with your knees slightly bent.
- Unlike Lindy Hop, WCS does not have a mandatory "pulse", meaning that you
  don't have to bend your knees or bounce at the rhythm of the beat. That being
  said, you can use the pulse if it is a feeling and look you are going for.

From Luke:

- When stepping backward in a sugar push, do it as if doing a moonwalk, because
  your feet should remain connected to the slot.
- When doing a telemark, which is technically a scroll, cut across the slot on
  5&6. Do not step around the slot.

## General West Coast Swing knowledge

- There are 6 pattern types:

  - four count triple pairs (4 beats)
  - side passes (6 beats): result in 0.5 turns
  - sugar pushes (6 beats)
  - whips (8 beats)
  - redirects
  - dips
  - lifts

- Side passes are named from the leader's perspective. For example, in a left
  pass, the follower passes by the leader's left side.

- In West Coast Swing, the dancer is trying to trace his or her path on the
  floor while dancing, meaning that the feet should be in contact with the floor
  if possible. For example, this means that the first two steps in a sugar push
  should look like Michael Jackson's moonwalk because the feet are always in the
  contact with the floor. When stepping forward, the follower also needs to
  trace the path while moving forward with the inside front part of the foot.
  The foot comes off the floor when the change is moved onto the hill. When the
  lead walks forward, he also needs to trace the path on the floor with the
  inside front part of the foot, but the weight change may happen on the ball of
  the foot as opposed to the hill because the lead may need to apply force on
  the ball of the foot to to stop the follower's movement.

## Musicality

- Music is commonly written in the 4/4 time signature and commonly structured in
  sets of 8 beats.
- The 4/4 time signature means 4 quarter notes per bar. How long is a quarter
  note? In this case it is one beat long, but that is not the case for other
  time signatures. The length of the beat is defined by the beats per minute
  (BPM) in a song.

  For example, if a song is fast and has 120 beats per minute, then there are
  two beats per minute. In other words, counting 8 beats will take 4 seconds.

- You can approximate the beats per minute in a song by counting 8 beats and
  seeing how many seconds it takes. If you started counting when the music
  player was at 2min 15 sec and you finished counting when it was at 2min 20
  sec, then 8 beats take 5 seconds.

  If it takes 5 seconds to count 8 beats, then you are listening to a mid-tempo
  song with \\(((8 beats / 5 seconds) \* 60 seconds / 1 minute) = 96\\) beats
  per minute.

  If it takes 3 seconds to count 8 beats, then you are listing to a really fast,
  non-danceable song of \\(((8 beats / 3 seconds) \* 60 seconds / 1 minute) =
  160\\) beats per minute.

- West Coast Swing competitions usually feature songs around 100 beats per
  minute, so that means songs between 80 to 120 beats per minute are good for
  social dancing.
- A major phrase is 32 beats. A minor phrase is 16 beats (usually) or 8 beats
  (rarely). Songs are usually structured in sets of minor and major phrases.
- Contemporary music is written in 8 bar phrases, and each bar has 4 beats. This
  means there are 32 beats in a phrase. In Blues each phrase is 12 bars, so
  there are 48 beats in each phrase.
- All ballroom dances except Waltz are written in 4/4 time and can be danced
  using 8 beat patterns:
  - Bachata: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Chacha: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Polka: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Two Step: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Salsa: 8-beat patterns
  - West Coast Swing: primarily 6- and 8-beat patterns, with 10- and 12-beat
    patterns requiring a rock-and-go
  - Waltz is written in 3/4 time signature and has 6-beat patterns

## Musicality exercises

Musicality is hard. I suspect it will take anywhere from 3 months to 2 years to
learn.

### Counting straight 8's

1. Count straight 8s up to 12 times. Repeat this exercise at least 3 times
   without mistakes.
2. Count straight 8s up to 12 times in sync with music. Repeat this exercise at
   least 3 times without mistakes.
3. Count straight 8s up to 12 times while doing whips. You may get unbearably
   dizzy. Repeat this exercise at least 3 times without mistakes.
4. Same as 3, but doing sugar pushes only.
5. Same as 3, but doing left-side passes only.
6. Same as 3, but doing right-side passes only.
7. Same as 3, but doing a sequence of 4 6-beat patterns and 1 8-beat pattern to
   add up to 32 beats.
8. Count straight 8s in sync with music for an entire song. Reset the count
   after each major phrase change. Repeat this exercise 3 times.
9. Same as 8, but doing whips only.
10. Same as 8, but doing sugar pushes only.
11. Same as 8, but doing left-side passes only.
12. Same as 8, but doing right-side passes only.
13. Same as 8, but doing a sequence of 4 6-beat patterns and 1 8-beat pattern.
14. To develop your phrase change intuition, jump to random points in a song and
    count the beats leading up to a major phrase change at least one third of
    the time.
15. Same as 14, but while dancing any 6- and 8-beat patterns required to hit the
    phrase change.
16. Listen to a song and pay attention to the chord progression. Detect the
    major phase change before it happens without doing any counting.
17. Now do 14, 15, and 16 all simultaneously. If you can manage to do this, you
    are a musicality professional.

These exercises miss a few things, like how to gracefully get on beat if dancing
off-beat by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 beats.

You don't have to hit all the phrase changes in the song. Aim for 1, then 2,
then 3, then all of them for a specific song you are familiar with.

Rules: once the song starts and you make your first move, you cannot bail out
and stop dancing. Doesn't matter how fast, how slow, how tired, how sloppy, how
confused you may be.

Note: I count beats in sets of 8 so I can do quick math on the total number of
beats I have danced. The way I count beats in a song is as follows:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **1** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **2** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **3** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **..**

### Accentuating the 1

Dance your basic patterns while counting straight 8s. Accentuate the 1 by any
means necessary. This may mean a slide on 1, a back drop on 3, or a side check
or sweep on 5. You can accentuate the 1 by accentuating the 3&4 compression on a
sugar tuck. You may also sweep or point your free arm or head. Accentuations
will all fall on 1, 3, or 5 while counting straight 8s to 6-beat patterns.

**1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 **1** 2 3 4 5 6 ...

#### Sugar push

- on 1: do a [hitch] step or [level change]
- on 3: do a back drop while angling your body leftwards or a [brush] backwards
- on 5: do a [right side-check] side-check or a [clockwise sweep]

## Rhythm

Not really WCS related, but ...

I have been told contradictory information about Rumba and Waltz:

- Rumba and Waltz have a box step, but the Rumba rhythm is slow, quick, quick,
  while the Waltz rhythm is even because all steps are the same speed
- Rumba and Waltz have the same rhythm: slow, quick, quick

## Rock-and-go (RAG)

A rock-and-go (RAG) combines the last two steps of a pattern with the first two
steps of the next pattern.

A RAG reduces the beat count by 2, e.g:

- two 6 step patterns become 10 counts instead of 12
- an 8 beat whip and a 6 beat basic become 12 counts instead of 14
- an 8 beat whip and an 8 beat whip become 14 counts instead of 16

When leading a rock-and-go, do not let the follower settle back on the anchor
step. The RAG must happen quickly so the anchor step --- which usually happens
in place --- turns into triple step that moves the follower forward:

- In a basic 6 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 5&6 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5&2 or 1 2 3&4 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly so the
  follower does not settle on steps &6, but instead moves forward.
- In a basic 8 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 7&8 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5 6 7&2 or 1 2 3&4 5 6 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly
  so the follower does not settle on steps &8, but instead moves forward.

## Turn variations

### Turn

A traveling turn that uses normal, cross, or hook steps.

### Pirouette

A stationary spin on one leg.

### Pivot turn

A stationary turn in which the weight changes from one foot to the other,
usually for a half-turn.

### Chain turn

A traveling turn in which the weight changes from one foot to the other, usually
for a half-turn.

## Preparation variations

A prep is used to rotate the follower clockwise or counter-clockwise.

### J-hook

Use it to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into a [starter] position
during a whip.

### L-hook

Use it from a [handshake] hold to rotate the follower counter-clockwise 180
degrees into a [closed] position during a whip.

Make sure this hand preparation is done at waist level, not a chest level, so it
is more comfortable for the follower.

### Piston

Use it from an [open] hold to to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into
a [back-to-front] position during a [single-arm turn-in]. It consists of pulling
the follower's arm on 1 and pushing it on 2.

### Left

Pull straight back on 1 while engaging your latissimus dorsi, not your forearm
or bicep muscles. Prep slightly to the left between 1 and 2, and rotate your
hand counter-clockwise in a circular motion on 3.

I have verified that the [Left] prep happens on 1.5 with Ray Trusty and with
Damon D'Amico.

Use it in a:

- [left-side inside chain turn]
- [right-side inside chain turn]
- [handshake reverse whip]
- [free spin]
- [fold]

### Right

Used it from the right-pass outside spin. Forward on 1, prep slightly to the
right between 1 and 2, and rotate clockwise on 3.

## Handhold configurations

The palm of the hand can point in four general directions:

- upwards (supination)
- inside (facing the interior)
- downwards (pronation)
- outside (facing the exterior/posterior)

Handhold configurations do not have formal names, but I refer to them like so:

- right to right: handshake handhold
- left to left: scout handshake handhold
- left to right: regular handhold
- right to left: goofy handhold
- left to right and right to left: double handhold
- left to left over right to right: cross-up handhold
- right to right over left to left: cross-down handhold

Examples:

- A double handed sugar tuck into a hammerlock.
- A double handed sugar push inside turn into a sweetheart.
- A crossed-up sugar push inside turn into a cross-down handhold.[^1]
- A crossed-down sugar push outside turn (sugar tuck) into a cross-up
  handhold.[^1]
- A double handed sugar tuck with a left hand release into a goofy handhold.[^1]

## Stance configurations

Stance configurations define how the leader and the follower stand relative to
each other and what handhold configuration they are in.

### Closed

The leader's right hand palm is on the follower's back, on the follower's left
shoulder blade, and the follower's left arm rests on the leader's right arm. The
leader stands face-to-face to the follower, sort of like the characters ||.

Paraphrased advice from Damon D'Amico:

In general, in a closed position, the leader's wrist should rest against the
crook of the follower's armpit, the axilla. There should be no gap between the
wrist and the armpit. This is where the steering power comes from.

Reached via:

- Left side pass with inside turn from goofy position
- [sugar push inside pivot turn into closed position]
- [right-side pass into closed position]
- [left-side inside chain turn into closed position]

Leads to:

### Starter

The handwork is identical to the [closed] position, but the leader stands
perpendicularly to the follower's left side, sort of like the characters \_|.

Reached via:

- [continuous whip into starter position]
- [right-side inside turn into starter position]
- [head drape into starter]

### Open

The leader's left-hand ring and middle fingers (pointing to the right) are held
by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at waist level, sort of like the
characters |¯|.

Reached via:

- [left-side inside chain turn]

#### Horn

The leader's ring and middle fingers point down. The hand looks like the sign of
horns.

Reached via:

- Sugar tuck from [open] position

#### Spiderman

The leader's ring and middle fingers point up. The hand looks like spiderman
shooting a spider web.

#### Weird

The leader's left-hand ring and middle fingers point to the left.

The leader's right-hand ring and middle fingers point to the right.

### Goofy

This is mirror image of the [open] position. The leader's right-hand ring finger
and middle fingers (pointing to the left) are held by the follower's left hand
(pointing down) at waist level, sort of like the characters |\_|.

Reached via:

- [goofy right-side inside turn]

#### Goofy horn

This is a mirror image of the [horn] position.

#### Goofy spiderman

This is a mirror image of the [spiderman] position.

#### Weird goofy

This is a mirror image of the [weird] position.

### Handshake

This is the same as the [open] position, but it requires a right-to-right hand
connection instead of a left-to-right hand connection, sort of like the
characters |/|.

Reached via:

- [right-side inside turn lead inside turn into handshake position]
- [sugar push right shoulder slide]

#### Horn Handshake

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [horn] handhold.

#### Spiderman Handshake

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [spiderman] handhold.

Reached via:

- [sugar push right shoulder slide]

Reached via:

- [Chuck turn into weird handshake]
- [apache whip]

Leads to:

- [hairbrush]
- [handshake reverse whip]

### Scout

This is short for "scout handshake".

This is a mirror image of the [handshake] position because it requires a
left-to-left hand connection instead of a right-to-right hand connection, sort
of like the characters |\\|.

Reached via:

- [behind-the-back whip]

#### Horn Scout

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [horn] handhold.

#### Spiderman Scout

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [spiderman] handhold.

#### Weird Scout

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [weird] handhold.

### Parallel

A specific double handhold. The leader's left hand ring finger and middle finger
(pointing to the right) are held by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at
waist level, and the leader's right hand ring and middle finger (pointing to the
left) are held by the follower's left hand (pointing down) at waist level sort
of like the characters |=|.

Reached via:

- [contemporary Hustle whip]
- [right-side inside pass into parallel position]

### Back-to-front

The follower and the leader face in the same direction while the follower stands
in front of the leader while holding the leader's hand in a regular handhold at
waist-level.

Reached via:

- [single-arm turn-in]

### Left hammerlock

The leader stands slightly to the left of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's left hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the right hand is pointing down.

Reached via:

- [double-arm turn-in]
- [hustle whip outside pivot turn]

### Right hammerlock

The leader stands slightly to the right of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's right hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the left hand is pointing down.

### Left shoulder-lock

A leader [left hammerlock]. A [closed] position variation. The leader stands
face to face with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the
left of the follower because the leader holds the follower's right hand with the
left hand from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the right
hand on the follower's right shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other
pattern. This position can be reached by the leader by starting from an open
position and performing a right-side pass inside turn with a leader clockwise
turn without releasing the follower's hand.

### Right shoulder-lock

A leader [right hammerlock]. A [closed] position variation. The leader stands
face to face with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the
right of the follower because the leader holds the follower's left hand with the
right hand from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the left
hand on the follower's left shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other
pattern. [^1]

### Left waiter

An [open] position in which the leader has the palm of his left hand
horizontally positioned over his left shoulder (like a waiter carrying a big
plate of food). In this case, the hand is as close to the shoulder and to the
neck as comfortably possible. This hold requires the leader and the follower to
be facing in the same direction, sort of like >¯>, where the follower stands
behind the leader as the leader holds the follower's hand at the shoulder.
Usually the next step is to leave the follower's hand at the shoulder.

### Right waiter

An [open] position in which the leader has the palm of his right hand
horizontally position over his right shoulder (like a waiter carrying a big
plate of food). In this case, the hand is as close to the shoulder and to the
neck as comfortably possible. This hold requires the leader and the follower to
be facing in the same direction, sort of like >\_>, where the follower stands
behind the leader as the leader holds the follower's hand at the shoulder.
Usually the next step is to leave the follower's hand at the shoulder.

### Left shoulder

An [open] position in which the leader has the back of his right hand touching
his left shoulder. In this case, the hand should rest over the shoulder close to
the neck, with the palm of the hand visible and pointing up and to the left.
This position is reached by bringing your right hand over your head onto your
left shoulder, like tracing the character ⋂ over your head (an upside down U)
while rotating 180 degrees clockwise (this can be done in two steps, like in a
salsa left turn steps 3 and 4). At the end of the turn, the leader and the
follower will be facing in the same direction, sort of like >¯>, where the
follower stands behind the leader as the leader holds the follower's hand at the
shoulder. Usually the next step is to leave the follower's hand at the shoulder.

### Right shoulder

An [open] position in which the leader has the back of his left hand touching
his right shoulder. In this case, the hand should rest over the shoulder close
to the neck, with the palm of the hand visible and pointing up and to the right.
This position is reached by bringing your left hand over your head onto your
right shoulder, like tracing the character ⋂ over your head (an upside down U)
while rotating 180 degrees clockwise (this can be done in two steps, like in a
salsa right turn steps 2 and 3). At the end of the turn, the leader and the
follower will be facing in the same direction, sort of like >\_>, where the
follower stands behind the leader as the leader holds the follower's hand at the
shoulder. Usually the next step is to leave the follower's hand at the shoulder.

### Right picture

In this position, you stand next-to-and-to-the right of the follower, with your
hips only a couple of inches apart. Both of you face in the same direction with
your faces, bodies, and feet. The follower's right arm extends from your left
shoulder, behind your neck, and the right hand rests on your right shoulder.
Meanwhile, your left hand rests on the follower's upper back or on the
follower's left shoulder.

## Pattern count combinations

Many popular songs are composed such that each phrase is 32 beats. The leader
can use this knowledge to sequence his/her patterns such that they add up to 32
beats, leading to sequences that consistently end on a phrase change.

If you start dancing at the beginning of a phrase change, then you must sequence
your patterns to add up to 32. If started late by two steps, then you sequence
must last 30 beats, etc.

The equations below split up the total number of beats into chunks that can be
translated into specific patterns. For example, the equation \\(32=6+6+6+6+8\\)
could be translated into \\(4\\) basic patterns and \\(1\\) whip.[^2]

I am not sure whether 4-beat or 2-beat patterns exist in West Coast Swing. There
are starter steps that are 4-beats long, but they are only used to start the
dance. Also, 6-beat and 8-beat patterns may be lengthened via styling to make
them 2 beats longer, but I have never heard of a standalone 2-beat pattern.

Some ways to lengthen a pattern by 2 beats are:

- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with a 4-beat, slow, and smooth sweep
- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with 4 small steps, 1-beat each
- Split the 6-beat or the 8-beat pattern into 2-beat increments, and repeat any
  2-beat increment. For example, a 6-beat pattern can be split into 2-beat
  increment like walk-walk triple-step triple-step, and then lengthened by
  2-beats by adding another walk-walk at the beginning or another triple-step
  any time after the initial walk-walk. It is a subtle form of copy-and-paste.

## Patterns

There are two types of pattern names: common names and descriptive names.

Common names are short and not descriptive. Whenever you hear a common name, you
either know the pattern or you do not. These are the official or well-known
pattern names.

Common pattern names include: left-side pass, sugar tuck, sugar push, free spin,
roll-in-roll-out.

Descriptive names are long and describe the movements in the pattern. Whenever
you hear a descriptive name, you are able to imagine what the pattern may look
like. These names are not well-known. I made them up.

Descriptive names include: left-side pass with a follower inside chain turn,
whip with a follower inside turn, left-side with a follower free chain turn.

### Pre-starter steps

Use pre-starter steps to find the beat in the music and to verify the follower
is also feeling the beat. You can [lock the knee] or [left diagonal tap right
diagonal tap] while counting 5678.

Use pre-starter steps at the beginning of a song for two accomplish two goals.
First, establish a connection with the follower. Second, set the tone or the
atmosphere for the song. Make it fun, playful, smooth, sensual, bluesy, stylish,
etc. Whatever you do, smile and have fun. Don't get serious and make it boring.

#### Left diagonal tap right diagonal tap

Start in an [open] or [closed] position. On 1 do a tap step diagonally forward
at 11 o'clock with your left foot and on 2 bring your left foot diagonally
backward so you step in place and change weight onto your right leg. On 3 do tap
step diagonally forward at 1 o'clock with your right foot and on 4 step
diagonally backward with your right foot so you step in place as you change
weight onto your left leg. You should be in the original position. Note that tap
steps do not require a weight change, meaning that a 4-beat groove cycle only
requires 2 weight changes.

This groove can be turned into a [forward tap forward triple].

#### Lock the knee

Start in an [open] or [closed] position. On 1 put your weight on your right foot
and hip, place your left foot at 10:30 about 1 foot away from your center of
mass. Use your right hip to counter-balance your left foot for style. On 2, flex
your left calve and bend your left knee so only the ball of your left foot
touches the floor while still maintaining your weight on your right foot. On 3
extend your left calve and lock your left knee so your left foot is flat against
the floor. Repeat steps 2 and 3.

### Starter steps

#### Forward tap forward triple

Start in [closed] position. On 1 do a tap with your left foot and on 2 step
forward with your left foot such that it points at 10 o'clock. Notice how it was
2 beats but only one weight change. On 3&4 there should be a push and a pull. On
3&4 do a triple step forward while making your body and left foot point at 9
o'clock so that you end in a [starter] position.

#### Left triple forward triple into starter position

Start in [closed] position. On 1&2 do a triple step with your left foot pointing
at 10:00 as you move in the 9:00 direction. On 3&4, do a triple step forward
such that step 3 is a step from behind your center of mass to the front of your
center of mass with the right leg while making your body and left foot point at
9 o'clock so that you end in a [starter] position.

### Sugar pushes

On 1, step back with left foot, on 2, step back with right foot, on 3&4 do a
rock step, and on 5&6 do an anchor step.

#### Sugar push outside pivot turn

Also known as a Sugar Tuck.

On 1 step back, on 2 raise your left hand to the follower's ear level such that
the hands are palm-to-palm. The leader's hand can be pointing straight up at 12
o'clock or angled, pointing at 10 o'clock. The left arm should be kept close to
the body before and after the turn, as if holding a piece of paper under the
armpit, even during the turn. On 3&4 do the rock step while slightly pressing
into the followers raised hand. The follower should press your hand back with
the same amount of force to achieve compression. The turn should begin
immediately on 4 after the compression was created on 3& and movement forwards
has begun. The turn should be completed in one beat so there is time for the
follower to anchor on the 5&6.

#### Sugar push inside pivot turn

Start in an [open] position. On step 2 raise your left hand and make it
perpendicular to the floor. Your hand must be aligned with the follower's left
shoulder. The hand connection should be palm-to-palm and the leader's left hand
should be pointing at 2 o'clock to indicate the direction of the pivot turn. On
3&4 generate compression on the 3& and begin the turn on 4 as you step forwards.
End in an [open] position.

#### Goofy sugar push inside pivot turn

Start in a [goofy] position. On step 2 raise your right hand to her face level
and align your right hand with her left shoulder while your hand points at 2
o'clock. On step 3&4 do compression on 3& and begin the counter-clockwise turn
around her head on 4 as you step forwards. Anchor on 5&6. You should end in a
[goofy] position.

#### Goofy sugar push outside pivot turn

Start in a [goofy] position. On step 2 raise your right hand to her face level
and align your right hand a couple of inches above her forehead while your hand
points at 10 o'clock. On step 3&4 do compression on 3& and begin the clockwise
turn around her head on 4 as you step forwards. Anchor on 5&6. You should end in
a [goofy] position.

#### Handshake sugar push outside pivot turn

Start in a [handshake] or [spiderman handshake] position. On step 2 raise your
right hand to her face level and align your right hand a couple of inches above
her forehead while your hand points at 10 o'clock. On step 3&4 do compression on
3& and begin the turn on 4 as you step forwards. Anchor on 5&6. You should end
in a [handshake] position.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [weird handshake left-side pass inside chain turn right picture hold]

#### Sugar push inside pivot turn into closed position

The footwork is the same as a [sugar push inside pivot turn], and the handwork
is the same up to step 3&. For the handwork, on 3& you should see the follower's
back, so place your right hand onto the followers left shoulder blade to achieve
a [closed] position as the turn finishes and you step forward on 4.

Specifically, during the turn, place your right-hand fingers in between the
follower shoulder blades. As the follower rotates, the right hand will be flat
against the shoulder blade, achieving a closed position. Steps 4, 5&6 may need
to be bigger than usual to close the gap between you and the follower, otherwise
there will be a lot of space between you both, as if you were in an open
position.

#### No-triple sugar tuck

This is a sugar tuck but the 3&4 becomes a 3 and 4 step-tap because the & goes
away.

For the leader's footwork, there is no 3&4, it is only 3 and 4. Step 1 is back,
step 2 is back and to the right. Step 3 is a tap step such that the leg points
to the floor and slightly to the left, but your weight is still on your right
leg from step 2. On step 4, you shift weight onto your left leg that was
pointing to the floor. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step.

The follower also has the option to avoid the triple step by simply stepping
forward on 1 with the right foot into point A, forward on 2 with the left foot
while having the right foot plant fully flexed and still positioned on point A.
Compression will happen on 3& like usual, and the right foot will rotate
clockwise around point A on 4 to perform the outside turn.

Followers also have the advanced option to perform no-triple sugar tucks by
kicking with the right leg on 2 and using the leg's momentums to propel oneself
through the turn.

#### Single-arm turn-in

The footwork is the same as in a sugar push for the leader. Use it from an
[open] hold. Steps 1 and 2 are for executing a [piston] so the follower will
turn 180 degrees into [back-to-front] position by the end of step 2. On 3& raise
your left arm over her head. On 4 gently push her back in between her shoulder
blades so she knows to walk under the arm. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step. You
should end in a [back-to-front] position.

#### Double-arm turn-in

Same as [single-arm turn-in], but use both hands to do a [left hammerlock]. It
is technically possible to achieve the same by doing a sugar tuck while holding
the follower's left hand, but the correct way is to do a pump prep, which
happens at waist level. You should end in a [left hammerlock] position.

#### Head drape

Same as a [hairbrush], but the hand goes over the follower's head. Also known as
a head-wrap.

Start in a [handshake] position; a [scout] hold also works. The footwork is the
same as in a sugar push; only the handwork changes. For the head-wrap, bring
your right and her right hand to her nose level on 1 while stepping back. On 2,
move your right hand from her nose level to her nape and leave her right hand on
her nape. On 3&4 slide your right hand down her left arm to go into a [goofy]
handhold and post to avoid moving further down the slot. On 5&6 do an anchor
step. You should end in a [goofy] position.

If you start in a [scout] position, the [head drape] would end in an [open]
position.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [head drape into starter] position

#### Head drape into starter

Start in a [handshake] position. Same as a [head drape] up to step 2. For the
handwork, on 3&4, rather than sliding your right arm down the follower's left
arm, you will slide your right hand under the follower's left armpit to go into
a [closed] position; curl your wrist and fingers before you slide your right
hand under the armpit and smoothly twist your wrist from 9:00 to 6:00 to 3:00
like drawing the letter U with your wrist as you slide under the armpit; at the
same time on 3&4, grab the follower's right hand with your left hand as if going
in an [open] position.

For the footwork, on 4, you will step towards 12:00 with your left toes pointing
at 10:30. On 5&6 do an anchor step; end facing 9:00 with your body and toes; be
in a [starter] position.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [closed right-side pass redirect]

#### Hairbrush

Same as a [head drape], but the hand goes over the leader's head. Also known as
a head-wrap.

Start in a [handshake] position; a [scout] hold also works. The footwork is the
same as in a sugar push; only the handwork changes. For the head-wrap, bring
your right and her right hand to your nose level on 1 while stepping back. On 2,
move your right hand from your nose level to your nape and leave her right hand
on your nape. On 3&4 she may slide her right hand down your left arm to go into
a [goofy] handhold; post at the end of 4 to avoid moving further down the slot.
On 5&6 do an anchor step. You should end in a [goofy] position.

If you start in a [scout] position, the [head drape] would end in an [open]
position.

#### Sugar tuck chase

Same as a sugar tuck up to but not including step 4. Step 4 should be big and
steps 5&6 should be big steps backward as the tuck turn happens. Usually, the
follower does a turn, but this time the follower will do a 1.5 turn so the
follower is facing backward. The leader should be on the follower's left side,
with the chest pointing to the followers left shoulder, in a [starter] position.
The [starter] position can be followed by a passing tuck!

#### Sugar tuck pirouette

Same as a tuck turn, but on step 4 the left hand applies more force so the
follower can do a double spin. Make sure to draw a halo around the follower's
head twice.

#### Chuck turn into weird handshake

A pattern that _Chuck_ Anders taught me.

Start in an [open] position. The footwork is the same as a [sugar push outside
pivot turn] up but not including step 4. On step 4, rather than stepping forward
into the slot at 12 o'clock, step forward and to the right slightly outside of
the slot at 3 o'clock. On 5&6 do 0.5 turns clockwise so you will face 9 o'clock
by the end of the pattern. The handwork is the same up to step 4. On 5&6 bring
both of your hands to your lower back to swap the follower's right hand from
your left hand to your right hand. The swap should happen around 5&. By 6 you
should be in a [weird handshake].

#### Sugar push right shoulder slide

Start in an [open] position. The footwork is the same as in a sugar push. The
only difference is the handwork and the middle-body work. The handwork on 1 and
2 is bringing your left hand over your head and then to your right shoulder. The
palm of your hand should point up and be parallel to the floor on 1 to create a
frame that looks like an upside-down, mirrored letter L (o˥) so that your head
will go under the frame. In specific, your left hand should be about 1 inch
above your head and the palm of your left hand should be horizontal and your
fingers should point at 9 o'clock whenever the hand is over your head, and your
left wrist should be aligned with your right ear. At the end of 2, the back your
left hand should be pressed against the right side of your neck, so release the
follower's right hand because it has been positioned in your right shoulder.
Depending on the follower's arm-reach and your height, you will need to bend
your back on 1 and 2 so that the follower is able to have the right hand go over
your head and reach the right shoulder. On 3&4 keep your left hand at the right
shoulder while offering your right hand by placing it under-and-in-front of your
left elbow. The follower's hand should slide down your left forearm onto your
right hand by the end of 4. You should be in an regular [handshake] or a
[spiderman handshake] by the end of 5&6.

#### Sugar push left shoulder slide

Start in a [goofy] or [parallel] position. The footwork is the same as in a
sugar push. The only difference is the handwork and the middle-body work. The
handwork on 1 and 2 is bringing your right hand over your head and then to your
left shoulder. The palm of your hand should point up and be parallel to the
floor on 1 to create a frame that looks like an upside-down L (Γo) so that your
head will go under the frame. In specific, your right hand should be about 1
inch above your head and the palm of your left hand should be horizontal and
your fingers should point at 3 o'clock whenever the hand is over your head, and
your right wrist should be aligned with your left ear. At the end of 2, the back
your right hand should be pressed against the left side of your neck, so release
the follower's left hand because it has been positioned in your left shoulder.
Depending on the follower's arm-reach and your height, you will need to bend
your back on 1 and 2 so that the follower is able to have the left hand go over
your head and reach the left shoulder. On 3&4 keep your right hand at the left
shoulder while offering your left hand by placing it under-and-in-front of your
right elbow. The follower's hand should slide down your right forearm onto your
right left by the end of 4. You should be in an regular [scout] or a [spiderman
scout] handshake by the end of 5&6.

#### Sugar push lead outside pivot turn to handshake

Alternate names:

- Sugar push clockwise hand change
- Sugar push leader clockwise turn

Start from an [open] position. This step is the same as a sugar push up to
step 4. On steps 5&6, do the footwork of a salsa right turn (for steps 2, 3, and
5). In other words, the right foot steps at 5 o'clock moving backwards, then the
left foot at 7 o'clock doing a 180 degree clockwise turn and stepping in front
of the right foot, and then the right foot at 12 o'clock moving forward. On step
5 bring your right hand to your lower back with the palm of your hand open and
pointing away, ready to grab the incoming hand. On step 5, as the outside pivot
turn finished, bring your left hand to your lower back while holding the
followers hand, and then swap the follower's hand to your right hand. By the end
of the &6 you should be in a [handshake] position. If you only do 0.75 turns
instead of the full turn, you will not be face-to-face with the follower. You
may use this as styling, but it will make the following pattern harder to do.

Alternative explanation:

Start from an [open] position. Do a sugar push, but on 4, step with the left
foot such that you face 3 o'clock. On 5 of the 5&6 rotate clockwise to face 12
o'clock while swapping the follower's hand from your left hand to your right
hand at butt-to-waist level behind your back. On the &6 of the 5&6 complete the
turn.

Alternative explanation:

Start from an [open] position. The footwork and handwork are the same as in a
[sugar push] up to 3&. The footwork on 4 is with your left foot stepping forward
pointing at 2 o'clock. On 5&6 do a clockwise pivot turn while switching hands
behind your back the hand-switch from your left hand to right hand should happen
on 5 around the butt-to-waist level while you are facing 6 o'clock. At the end
your body should point at 9 o'clock. You should end up in a [handshake]
position.

#### Sugar push lead inside pivot turn to scout position

Start from an [open] or [goofy] position. The footwork and handwork are the same
as in a [sugar push] up to 4. The footwork on 5&6 is the same as in a salsa left
turn. During 5&6 switch the follower's left hand from your right hand onto your
left hand. You should end in a [scout] position.

#### Sugar push clockwise duck to handshake

Alternative name: Back-to-neck hand-slide

Start in [open position]. Do a sugar push, but on 3&4 begin lowering your body
and pointing your body at 3 o'clock. Duck and slide under the right arm from a
hammerlock position. On 5&6 you may skip the triple. By 6 you should be
perpendicular to the follower, looking at 9 o'clock. You should end in
[handshake] position.

#### Mirrored inside pivot turn

Note that there are no triple steps in this pattern.

Start in an [open] position. On 1 and 2 step backwards towards 6:00. On 3 turn
180 degrees such that you are facing 6:00 and the follower is facing 12:00. On 3
you will do this by bringing your left hand all the way towards 3:00 and
immediately releasing your hand. You should be back-to-back and your shoulder
blades could be touching each other but they do not necessarily have to. On 3
and 4 your weight should be on your left leg as you are leaning towards the
left. On 5 and 6 you should lean towards the right and change your weight into
your right leg. On 7 you should turn clockwise by stepping on your left leg so
your body points at 10 o'clock. On 8 turn slightly clockwise by stepping on your
right leg while offering your left hand such that you end in an [open] position.

Variations:

- On 3 instead of releasing your left hand you may choose to keep it connected
  and continue the rest of the pattern while holding hands. This easier to
  follow.
- This pattern can be done from a [parallel] position while holding both hands
  throughout the entire rotation.

#### Handshake sugar push shoulder catch into scout

A pattern that Zach taught me.

Same as a sugar tuck up to 3. On & and 4 step forward while turning 0.5
clockwise at the same time that the follower turns 0.5 turns clockwise. On 4 you
should be behind and to the right of the follower while both of you face 6
o'clock. Immediately when the follower begins turning on &4 and you see the
back, while your right hand draws a halo over the follower, grab the follower's
left shoulder with your left hand like a hook so that you can pull back on the
shoulder on 5 and 6. On 5 and 6 release the follower's right hand as you step to
the left of the slot and face 3 o'clock. Do not push the shoulder forward at any
point; this will throw the followers off balance. Steps 7 8 are just a hold
while facing 3 o'clock as you stand in split weight with both feet. There are no
steps. You should end in a perpendicular [scout] position.

### Right-side passes

Also known as a fake whip.

#### Right-side inside turn

Also known as a right-side pass.

Starting in an [open] or [horn] position, step 1 is back and to the left, step 2
is back and to the left to face 3 o'clock. Do 3& in place and on 4 step into
slot with your left foot pointing at 12 o'clock. Handwork 1 is straight back, 2
is raising your left hand to the follower face level with the back of your hand
visible as if looking at the watch on your left hand. Handwork 3&4 is going over
the follower's head with the left hand, as if drawing an upside-down U over the
follower. The left-hand should finish at the follower right-shoulder level. On
5&6 lower your left hand to waist-level so you will end up in an [open]
position.

#### Right-side outside turn

I think Damon calls it a Dallas turn.

Start in a [handshake] position. On 1 step back at 6:00 with the left foot, on 2
step back at 6:00 with the right foot such that you face 3:00 while raising your
right hand to the follower's face level, making sure your right hand is aligned
with the follower's right-shoulder. Make sure to pull the follower back on steps
1 and 2, not just 1. On 2.5 give the follower a slight [right] prep (like 1.5
inches). On 3&4 lead an outside turn while doing regular right-side pass
footwork. This pattern will not work well if you are not facing 3:00 by 3 and
allow the follower to have the full slot. On 5&6 do an anchor step. You should
end in a [handshake] position.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [head drape into starter] position

#### Goofy right-side inside turn

Also known as a right-side underarm pass.

It starts from a [goofy] position and the footwork for the leader is the same as
in a right-side pass. The handwork is the mirrored equivalent from a [left-side
outside pass]. You should end in a [goofy] position.

#### Goofy left-side inside chain turn

It starts from a [goofy] position and the footwork for the leader is the same as
in a [right-side inside turn]. The handwork is the mirrored equivalent from a
[left-side outside pass]. You should end in a [goofy] position.

#### Right-side outside chain turn

Start from an [open] position. The footwork is the same as a [right-side inside
turn]. The handwork is different. On step 1 do a prep to your [right], and do
not do a prep for step 2, instead, go directly into a [J-hook] (rotating
clockwise) over her head. You have to be fast. It takes 2.5 chain turns.

#### Right-side inside pass into parallel position

Use it from an [open] hold. The footwork and most of the handwork is the same as
in a [right-side inside turn]. The follower will turn and her back should be
visible by the end of step 2. Immediately when the follower's back is visible,
slide your hand from her back to her shoulder (3&4), and down the arm (5). You
should have a [parallel] handhold when finishing the anchor step (5&6).

#### Right-side pass into closed position

Use it from an [open] hold. The footwork and most of the handwork is the same as
in a [right-side inside turn]. The follower will turn and her back should be
visible by the end of step 2. Immediately when the follower's back is visible,
place your right-hand fingers in between her shoulder blades. As the follower
rotates, the right hand will be flat against the shoulder blade, achieving a
[closed] position. In steps 3&4, make step 4 bigger. Also make 5&6 bigger than
usual to close the gap between you and the follower, otherwise there will be a
lot of space between you both, as if you were in an [open] position.

#### Right-side inside chain turn

Start from an [open] position. This is a right-side pass with chain 2.5 turns
instead of 1.5 turns. On step 1 step back and diagonally backward. In between 1
and 2 give a [left] prep toward her right ear and immediately begin spinning her
counter-clockwise for 2.5 turns. If you give two preps instead of 1, then the
turning will begin on step 3, and by that time it will be too late. The spinning
must begin on step 2 or right before step 3. You should end in a [open]
position.

#### Right-side outside leader turn into left shoulder-lock

Use it form an [open] hold. Same as a right-side pass up step 4. On the 5&6, the
leader turns clockwise 1 time to the left of the slot into a [left
shoulder-lock]. The back part of the hand should be firmly placed on the
follower's right shoulder for leading the following step.

Consider performing the 5&6 as an [cross-legged outside turn].

This pattern can be followed by a [left shoulder-lock reverse whip].

#### Short right-side inside turn

Also known as a short right-side pass.

A variation of the [right-side inside turn].

It is like an L in Tetris, whereas a regular right-side pass is the straight
piece in Tetris. Step 1 is back-leftwards, and step two is a cross step. The
movement leftwards happens on number 4. In other words, rather than stepping
into the slot on step 4, you are stepping past the slot. The anchor step can be
a [front-check] or a [back-check].

#### Right-side inside turn lead inside turn into handshake position

A variation of the [right-side inside turn].

Starting in an [open] position, step 1 is back and to the left, step 2 is back
and to the left to face 3 o'clock. Do 3& in place and on 4 step into slot with
your left foot pointing at 3 o'clock. On 5&6 do 0.75 a counter-clockwise pivot
turn. Handwork 1 is straight back, 2 is looking at the watch. Handwork 3&4 is
going over the follower's head with the left hand, as if drawing an upside-down
U over the follower. The left-hand should finish at the follower right-shoulder
level. On 4 open your left hand to release the follower's hand and raise your
right arm straight up as you walk into the slot. The follower's arm should be
pressed against your right rib by 5, right under the lifted right arm. On 5&6
lower your right arm smoothly as if surfing on a wave so you will end in a
[handshake] position.

You may opt to do feminine handwork on the 4 5&6. The handwork does not look
like asking a question, not like you are riding a bull, not like you are a
monkey, and not like you are in the 1920's. Your right arm must be pointed
straight up, perpendicular to the floor, with your elbow locked straight. Your
right bicep should be aligned with your right ear. If you are facing 12 o'clock
relative to the floor, then your right hand fingers must be pointing at 3
o'clock and the palm of your hand must be parallel to the floor. To lower your
right arm, bend your elbow in the 12 o'clock direction while your right hand
palm slides across the back of your head, neck, and right shoulder while your
right hand fingers point more or less towards the ceiling, perpendicular to the
floor.

#### Right-side inside turn lead inside turn into open position

This is a variation of the [right-side inside turn lead inside turn into
handshake position]. The only difference is the handwork on the 4, 5&6. Do not
raise your right arm on 4 5&6. Keep it at waist level. Instead, raise your left
hand while holding the follower's right arm so you can perform the 1.25
counter-clockwise turn under the follower's arm. You will end up in [open]
position because you never let go of the follower's right arm.

#### Right-side inside turn into starter position

Start in an [open] position. Steps 1 through 3& are the same as in a [right-side
inside turn]. Make sure step 3 is a back step, not a step in place. On step 4,
do not step into the slot with your left foot. Instead, cross in front of your
right leg with your left leg while moving toward the 6 o'clock direction. On
steps 5&6 uncross your right leg while moving slightly in the 6 o'clock
direction. Your steps will be smaller because you should already be in a
[starter] position.

On steps 3& you should be in a shadow position, meaning the follower's back
should be in front of you, so place your right-hand fingertips in between the
follower's shoulder blades. Make there is no gap between you right-hand wrist
and the follower's armpit once you go into [starter] position.

### Left-side passes

#### Left-side pass

Start from an [open] position. For the footwork, on 1 step backwards and to the
right 45 degrees counter-clockwise, on step 2 step step backwards and to the
right 45 degrees counter-clockwise. On step 3&4 step back and then front with
the left leg, such that step 4 goes back into the slot at a 45 degree angle. On
steps 5&6 do an anchor step, such that another 45 degrees are added on step 5.

#### Fold

Start from an [open] position. The footwork can be the same as in a [left-side
pass]. However, it looks better if on step 4 your body faces 9 o'clock because
the follower is also facing 9 o'clock. Then do the 5&6 anchor step to face 6
o'clock while the follower faces 12 o'clock. You should end in an [open]
position.

As for the handwork, on beats 1 thru 3 do a [left] hand prep at waist level. You
may use you left-hand middle and ring fingers and a sign-of-horn for the handle
on beats 3&4. You may also do a bracelet around the follower's wrist using your
pinky and thumb as she rotates on 3&4.

#### Scout fold RAG free spin

Start in a [scout] position. The footwork is the same as in a [fold] up to but
not including 4. On 3& you should be standing on the left side of the slot
facing 9 o'clock. On 4 take a step from the left side of the slot to the right
side of the slot with you left foot pointing at 5 o'clock and your body facing 6
o'clock. On 4, the goal is to move down the slot as the follower travels and end
up to the right of her, not behind of her. On 5&6 you should be facing 3
o'clock. On 7&8 do a triple step so you end up facing 2 o'clock. On 9&10 catch
the follower's hand while doing an anchor. You should end in an [open] position.
Notice that there is not a lot of travel in the 5&6 because you are unwinding
the follower; she cannot travel. On 7&8 there may not be a lot of travel either;
the spin begins on 7, so there is not a lot of travel that can happen on 7.

As for the handwork, on 1 lead the follower back with the left hand. On 1.5 do a
[left] prep. On 3&4 wrap the back of your left hand on the follower's right side
of the waist. On 4 the follower should be facing 6 o'clock and you should be
facing 9 o'clock. On 5&6 unwind the follower so she faces 12 o'clock. This is
the equivalent of steps 1 and the [left] prep in a [free spin]. For styling, on
5&6 you may choose to hold the follower's left forearm with your right hand. On
7&8 give the follower a counter-clockwise spin. On 9&10 catch the follower's
hand. You should end in an [open] position.

#### Left-side inside chain turn

Start from an [open] position. The footwork is the same as a left-side pass. The
handwork is different. On step 1 go straight back (maybe raising your hand to
her shoulder level). On 2 do [left] prep at the follower's face level. On 3&4
lead 1.5 chain turns. You should end in an [open] position.

#### Left-side inside chain turn into closed position

Start from an [open] position. The footwork and most of the handwork is the same
as a [left-side inside chain turn]. For the handwork, on 3& you should see the
follower's back, so place your right hand onto the followers left shoulder blade
to achieve a [closed] position as the turn finishes and you step forward on 4.

#### Left-side starter inside chain turn into open position

Whenever you are in a [closed] or [starter] position, your first two steps are
half the length, so the [left] prep for the inside chain turn will happen on 2
rather than between 1 and 2. [^3]

Start in a [starter] position. Steps 1, 2, and 3& are done while facing 9
o'clock. Step 1 is to 6 o'clock. Step 2 is to 6 o'clock, but you must cross your
right leg behind your left leg. Step 3 in the 3& is a back towards 3 o'clock so
that your left foot goes backwards more so than where the right foot is
standing. It looks better than doing the 3& in place. Step & in the 3& is done
almost in place because there is very little travel towards 6 o'clock. Step 4 is
diagonal towards 7:30 o'clock. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step. You should end in
an [open] position.

#### Left-side starter back-lead free-spin

Start in a [starter] position. The handwork for 1 is to lead the follower
towards 6 o'clock using a flat right hand. On 1.5 lead the follower towards 7
o'clock with the palm of your right hand, which is the equivalent of the [left]
prep. On 3 flex your wrist to lead the follower towards 5 o'clock. The right
hand will disconnect from the shoulder blade on 3 and the follower will enter
into a [free spin].

Typically for an [free spin], you would use your right hand to lead a [left]
prep on 1.5 and lead the follower into the turn. In this case you are doing the
same prep with the same hand and on the same beats, but from a [starter]
position.

#### Left-side starter outside turn into a weird handshake position

This is a pattern that Ray Trusty taught me.

Start in a [starter] position. Steps 1, 2, and 3& are done while facing 9
o'clock. Step 1 is to 6 o'clock. Step 2 is to 6 o'clock, but you must cross your
right leg behind your left leg. Step 3 in the 3& is a back towards 3 o'clock so
that your left foot goes backwards more so than where the right foot is
standing. It looks better than doing the 3& in place. Step & in the 3& is done
almost in place because there is very little travel towards 6 o'clock. Step 4 is
diagonal towards 7:30 o'clock. Your left foot may be able to finish pointing
directly at 6 o'clock. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step. You should end in an [weird
handshake] position.

For the handwork, you should be able to do this pattern with your left hand in
your pocket. On beats 1 and 2 your hand stays on the follower's left shoulder.
On step 3&4 you do a push-and-pull to lead the follower into a 0.5 clockwise
turn. For the pulling motion on 4, you may need to use your right-hand
fingertips to leverage the follower's left shoulder blade groove. Without the
grove, you will have nowhere to pull from. If you lead the 3&4 correctly, the
follower will do a [right side-check] while turning 0.25 turns clockwise. The
remaining 0.25 clockwise turn will be done by the follower on the anchor step.
On 5&6, as the follower turns clockwise, slide your right hand across the
follower's back while rotating it into a [weird handshake] position without
losing connection with the follower at any point throughout the entire pattern.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [handshake reverse whip]

#### Left-side outside pass

Also known as passing tuck.

For the handwork, start in [open] position. Raise your left hand above her head
by step 2 such that her right hand is in front and above her face with about 1
feet of distance. On the 3&4 there should be some compression buildup so the
highest compression happens on step 4 whenever you step into the slot and the
follower begins the turn. By step 6 the hands should go back down to about
waist-level.

#### Left-side pass outside pass turn into weird handshake position

Also known as a tuck turn.

Once you are in [starter] or a [closed] position, let go of your left hand. Put
your left hand in your pocket if you want to look cool. This pattern must be
lead entirely with the right hand.

Start from a [starter] or a [closed] position. Steps 1 and 2 are to your left
such that the right leg hooks behind the left. You should walk perpendicular to
the slot on steps 1 and 2. Step 3&4 requires you to push the follower at the
latissimus dorsi and then use your fingertips to pull the follower with a
rotating motion by flexing all your right hand fingertips except your thumb at
her left scapula middle border connection point. After you flex your fingertips
and the follower begins rotating, immediately turn your right hand into a
[weird] position without loosing connection with the follower's back. As the
follower rotates, slide your hand across the follower's right scapula, tricep,
forearm, and hand. You should be in [weird handshake] position by the time you
do an anchor step.

Next pattern suggestions:

- [hairbrush]
- [handshake reverse whip]

#### Free spin

A [goofy] unconnected [right-side inside chain turn].

Start from a [goofy] position. The footwork is the same as in a left-side pass.
On step 2 prep to the left and on step 3 throw the hand to the right so the
follower turns counter-clockwise. Step 3 is a back drop so that your backwards
body movement causes the follower to rotate counter-clockwise. On 4 don't walk
into the slot if possible; step in place. On 5, catch the follower's hand. On
5&6 do an anchor step. You should end in a [open] position.

#### Free spin leader pivot turn

Star from a [goofy] position. This pattern is identical to the [free spin] up to
step 3&. On 3& the follower faces 9 o'clock. On 4 the leader steps across while
rotating 0.5 turns clockwise to face 3 o'clock. On 5&6 rotate 0.25 turns
clockwise to face 6 o'clock while extending your left arm to grab the follower's
right arm and reach an [open] position.

#### Roll-in-roll-out

It is similar to a [free spin]. It requires a [goofy] handhold.

#### Left-side goofy inside chain turn into closed position

A pattern that [Bob Bowlby] and Joan Peeples taught me.

Prep 1 is on line with the follower's shoulder. Prep 2 is on line with the
follower's face. Step 3&4 is over and behind the followers head such that the
follower's hand gets released on step 4 so your right hand can slide down the
follower's head. On step 4 step back into the slot into closed position.

#### Trusty left-side pass

A pattern that Ray _Trusty_ taught me.

Use it from a [handshake] position. On 1, step back while turning 90 degrees
counter-clockwise. On 2, turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise so the follower is
facing your back. As you perform the half turn, bring your right hand over your
right shoulder and then drop the follower's hand on your shoulder. On 3&4 turn
180 degrees counter-clockwise such that the followers hand slides around the
back of your neck and down your left arm, leaving you in an [open] position.

#### Weird handshake left-side pass inside chain turn right picture hold walk-around into open position

Start form a [handshake] or a [weird handshake]. Lead an inside chain turn and
then go into a [right picture] position and then do a two-step walk-around
before anchoring back. On steps 1 and 2, lead two steps back and prep a
left-side pass with an inside chain turn. On steps 3&4, lead the inside chain
turn such that instead of drawing a halo over the follower, your right hand
draws a partial halo do you can bring your right hand behind her head, then
behind your left shoulder, head, and finally to your right shoulder. For the
turn to work such that you are able to bring your right hand behind your neck,
the follower's right hand must be prepped at neck level before the turn begins.
On &4, your left hand should also be extended at chest-level so that you catch
the follower's back by the end of the rotation. By the end of &4, you should
look like you are standing together to take a picture! On 4 also make sure to
make a bigger step than usual. You are not stepping into the slot, you are
stepping past it, since steps 4, 5, and 6 are part of the walk-around. On the
walk-around, the follower will step backwards and stay in place, while you step
forwards around her for 0.5 turns. Finally on 7&8, you will move away from each
other while her arm slides down your left hand so you will end up in [open]
position.

#### Left-side inside chain turn into wrap hip catch alternating chain turns

Start in a [parallel] position. Step 1 is back and to the right. On 2 step back
and face 9 o'clock. On 3&4 perform a triple step while facing 9 o'clock. On &5
step towards 6 o'clock such that you end up facing 9 o'clock with split weight
on both legs. Hold on 6 while building tension in the 12 o'clock direction. On
7&8 perform a triple step starting with your left foot while moving in the 12
o'clock direction. You should be facing 6 o'clock, at the follower. On 9&10
perform another triple step in the 12 o'clock direction. Make sure you have a
lot of clearance in the 12 o'clock direction if you decide to repeat steps 7&8
and 9&10. The remaining footwork will depend on the exit you take.

This pattern has three exits:

- hip-lead inside chain turn into closed position: on 11&12 pull on the left hip
  with your right hand while you turn counter-clockwise from 6 to 3 o'clock and
  step to the left of the slot. As the follower turns, keep your hand connected
  to the hip while maintaining force in the 12 o'clock direction, causing her to
  walk past you. Then use your left hand to grab her right hand. On 13&14 do an
  anchor step. You should end in an [open] position.

- hip-lead inside chain turn into left side redirect into open position: on
  11&12 pull on the left hip with your right hand. As the follower turns, keep
  your hand connected to the hip. As she turns and her back becomes visible,
  slide your hand from the right hip to the right armpit and catch the
  latissiums dorsi, absorbing the angular momentum. You should end in an [open]
  position. Perform a triple step on 13&14 to get on the right foot.

- hip-lead inside chain turn into a left-side dip into closed position: on 11&12
  pull on the left hip with your right hand while you turn counter-clockwise
  from 6 to 3 o'clock and step to the left of the slot. As she turns and her
  back becomes visible, slide your hand from the right hip to the right armpit
  and catch the latissiums dorsi, but to not absorb the angular momentum so she
  gets wrapped into your right arm as you lean to the right, causing a dip
  on 13. On 14 unwrap the hand while standing up, causing the follower to face
  12 o'clock. You should be in a [starter] position.

On 4, the follower should be wrapped in with both of your hands at waist level
while shes faces 6 o'clock and you face 9 o'clock, so release the left hand
without moving it away from the hip because you will pull you right hand to
unwind her and catch her hip on 5. On the & of the &5 the follower the follower
goes from facing 6 o'clock to facing 12 o'clock. The hip should already be
caught, but with little force. On 5 she faces 3 o'clock while your hand is still
on the hip.

In this pattern you must lead the alternating chain turns by the hip on beats
7&8 and 9&10. As you do so, your left hand hand can go from a regular position
when grabbing the left hip, to a weird position when grabbing the right hip. You
are not so much grabbing as you are hooking the hip and pulling on it to
generate the rotation. The belly and hip areas are safe. Anything below or above
that is not.

The initial 7&8 inside chain turn is done with the left hand, but you must
switch to using your right hand because this allows you to perform the exits
more cleanly.

#### Shadow position into sweetheart into scout handhold

Start in an over-rotated [open] position such that you face 3 o'clock as opposed
to 12 o'clock and the follower faces 9 o'clock instead of 6 o'clock.

On 1, turn clockwise while passing the follower's hand from your left hand to
your right hand so you face 9 o'clock and have a [handshake] handhold. On 2 your
left leg is free, so use it to do a left tap step. On 3 change weight onto your
left leg. On 4 do a right tap step. On 5 change your weight onto your right leg
and on 6 change your weight onto your left leg, creating a sense of compression
and tension that tells the follower to move in the 6 o'clock direction. On 7&8
do a triple step into a sweetheart, meaning you raise your left hand at shoulder
level to catch the follower's left hand. You also bring your hand to follower
shoulder height. Hold on 1 and 2 as the follower does a press line. On 2 pull
the follower backward while you stand with split weight. On 3&4 triple step
backward while entering a [scout] handhold position. There is no anchor.

Reached via:

- [whip with two outside turns into over-rotated open position]

### Whips

Start in an [open] position. On 1 you step back while performing a small
[J-hook] prep with the left arm. A common mistake is not to step back at 6
o'clock or to forget the prep. On 2 you face 3 o'clock and catch the follower by
the armpit. To be exact, your right hand should be under the follower's right
armpit such that there is no gap between the armpit and your hand. In other
word, your right hand palm should be pressed against the teres major, while your
fingers wrap around the lattisimus dorsi, and your thumb is pressed against the
top of the axilla, meaning the intersection between the teres major and the
triceps brachii long head. On 3& the right arm extends to where it is almost
straight, which allows the follower to step forward fully. If your right elbow
is flexed on the 3&, then it is as if you were telling the follower to move
forward even the she should be moving backwards! On 4 you step into the slot
such that you face 6 o'clock and the follower's right foot is positioned
directly between your feet. On 5 you step in the 12 o'clock direction while
turning your body to face at 9 o'clock such that your right arm is not straight
any more. Instead, your right elbow should be bent at a 90 degree angle such
that you are face-to-face with the follower. A common mistake is not to step
towards 12 o'clock on 5, which is necessary to tell the follower to move
forwards. Another common mistake is to keep the right arm locked instead of bent
at 90 degrees, causing the follower to move through the slot in a rounded path
as opposed to a straight line going directly from 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock. On 6
you release the right hand while you turn your body to face 12 o'clock. You post
on 6, meaning that you stop moving forward to tell the follower the pattern is
over. On 7&8 you do an anchor step. You should end in an [open] position.

#### Behind the back whip into shadow right shoulder catch

Damon calls it a pikaboo whip.

This pattern is the same as a [behind-the-back whip] up to but not including 4.
On 4, grab the followers left hand with your left hand and pull your left elbow
backwards towards 3:00. This will cause the follower to rotate 0.75 turns
clockwise such that you will end up in a shadow position facing 9:00 on 5. Make
sure to place your right hand preemptively at her shoulder level so that you
will be able to catch the follower right shoulder at the end of 5 and stop her
motion so that she will end up in a shadow position. On 5, while still facing
9:00 with your body and feet, you will step slightly backwards and down the slot
with your right foot towards 1:00 to create just enough space for crossing the
left leg. On 6 step towards 12:00 while crossing on front of the right leg. On
6, as you move down the slot, move the follower's left hand over her head onto
her right shoulder. Make sure there hand goes over her head in an upside-down U
shape. On 6, use your right hand, which should be on the follower's shoulder, to
hold her or slightly press her back towards 6:00, otherwise she may think that
she is supposed to move down the slot with you. On 7&8 slide your right hand
down the follower's right arm while performing a triple step while moving
towards 12:00. You should end in a [handshake] position and be facing 9:00 with
your body and toes.

Note: The count for the follower will be different on 5. They will do 5& instead
of just 5 because doing the rotation requires a triple step.

Next pattern suggestion:

- [right-side outside turn]

#### Basket whip

Steps 1 thru 4 are same as a right-side pass, but the handwork is different. For
handwork, make an L, such that the left arm points up and the right hand points
to left elbow. It is easier to start this pattern from a [parallel] handhold.

#### Basket whip with an outside turn

It looks like a basket whip with a tuck turn exit. It is the same as a [basket
whip] up to step 4. On step 5 raise the left hand (like in a tuck turn) and
release the right hand, turning the follower from steps 6 thru 8.

#### Basket whip with an spinning anchor

It looks like a basket whip with an accelerated tuck turn exit. It is the same
as a [basket whip] up to step 4. On step 5 raise the left hand on and release
the right hand, turning the follower from step 6 thru 8 with plenty of energy so
she can do a double spin. Make sure to draw a halo around her head twice.

#### Basket whip with arm escape

Start from an [open] or [parallel] position. Everything is the same as a [basket
whip] up to 4. Don't let your right hand go of the follower's left hand for the
entire pattern. On 5 let go of your left hand. You should be standing
perpendicular to the follower, looking at 9 o'clock while she looks at 6
o'clock. Your right arm should be extended across the followers back, with your
hand pressed directly under the follower's armpit-to-shoulder-blade fleshy part.
Your right hand should rotate 45 degrees in a counter-clockwise, pronating
motion around the follower's right shoulder-blade-armpit section. In other
words, your hand must not be at her waist level or her neck level. This rotation
will encourage the follower to duck slightly. If the follower does not know to
duck, release the right hand and gracefully toss it from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock
before putting it by your waist. She should have escaped by 6. You may choose to
skip the footwork after you reach 5. On 7&8 you are still perpendicular to the
follower, looking at 9 o'clock. The follower should move toward 12 o'clock while
facing 6 o'clock the entire time and then anchor. You should end in an [goofy],
perpendicular handshake.

#### Car-wash whip

It requires a [goofy] hold or a [parallel] hold. Be in a [goofy] hold by step 4.
Same as whip up to step 4, on 5 don't do a hook step, do a cross step forward.
Then turn counter-clockwise on 6 and do an anchor step 7&8. I think in step 5
you switch hands (from left to right) and bring your right hand to your lower
back, signaling her to go back. On step 5 you can give a strong indication for
the follower to turn clockwise by putting her left hand on your right hip. Her
left hand will collide with your right hip as she steps backwards and your hip
will push her arm clockwise.

#### Contemporary Hustle whip

A pattern that Zach taught me.

The contemporary Hustle whip is different from the regular Hustle whip because
you do not "open the newspaper" on the 1-and-2 or 5-and-6. If the follower is
not ready, opening the newspaper can hurt the follower (that is what Amber told
me). The contemporary Hustle whip is also different because it does not require
a parallel handhold at the start.

It starts from an [open] position and all the footwork is the same as in a
regular whip, but the handwork is different. Handwork 1 and 2 is the same as a
whip for the left hand because it is [J-hook], but the right hand is offered at
waist level with the palm up on 1. On 2, your body and your right hand should be
pointing at 3 o'clock. By 2, you should have the follower's left hand on your
right hand. On 5 move your right hand in front of your right hip. On 6 move your
left hand so it is parallel with the right hand. Anchor on the 7&8. You should
end in a [parallel] position.

#### Decapitate whip

A variation of a [handshake reverse whip]. It requires a [handshake] hold. Do a
[J-hook], but on step 3 don't release her right hand, go over her head. On step
4, hold or "cup" her left triceps with your left hand. Use your right hand to
turn her back into the right position.

#### Hustle whip

The footwork is the same as in a whip. For the handwork, a [parallel] handhold
is necessary. Open the arms on 1,2 and close them by 3&. Open the hands on 4,5,
and close them by 6. Post on 6 for the anchor step.

You may do a [car-wash whip] exit.

#### Hustle whip inside pass turn into open position

The footwork is the same as a [hustle whip], and the handwork is the same up to
step 4. On step 4, apply tension to lead the follower forwards while raising
your left hand. On 5, raise your left hand as though you were looking at your
clock. Your left hand should be aligned to her nose. On 6, as she is passing by,
draw an counter-clockwise halo around her head and release your right-hand grip.
Then do an anchor position in [open] position.

#### Hustle whip inside pass turn into parallel position

Same as a [hustle whip inside pass turn into open position] up to step 6. On
step 6, immediately when the follower's back becomes visible, slide your fingers
across her back, shoulder, and arm into a [parallel] hold.

#### Hustle whip outside pivot turn

The footwork is the same as a [hustle whip], and the handwork is the same up to
step 4. On step 4, apply tension to lead the follower forwards while raising
your left hand. On 5, raise your left hand as though you were asking a question.
On 5, lower your right hand so the follower is able to turn clockwise. Your left
hand should be at her right-ear level and at shoulder-width. On 6, as she is
passing by, draw a clockwise halo over her head without releasing your
right-hand grip. This should put you into a [left hammerlock] position with both
hands in a [weird] position, with the right hand against the follower's right
hip.

#### Hustle whip leader outside pivot turn into handshake position

A pattern that Howard Rodriguez taught me.

The footwork and handwork are the same as a regular [hustle whip] up to step 4.
On 5 and 6 go into a [right shoulder] position by brining your left hand to your
right shoulder while still holding onto her right hand and while doing 0.5 turns
clockwise (steps 2 and 3 in a salsa right turn). On 5 you should face 9 o'clock.
On 6 you should face 3 o'clock. On 7&8 do another 0.5 turns (steps 2 and 3 and
another 2 in a salsa right turn) as her right hand slides down your right
shoulder and hand into a [handshake] position looking at 9 o'clock.

A good pattern to do after this one is a [trusty left-side-pass].

#### Right-side pass reverse whip

From an [open] hold, for steps 1 thru 4, do a right-side pass into [closed]
position. You must not let the follower step back on step 4. You have to pull
her so she steps forward, otherwise she will already be anchored on her right
foot. In other words, on step 4, she must be stepping forward with her right
foot (in between your feet). If she is stepping backward, you are too late (put
fingers in between shoulder blades as she passes). For steps 5 thru 8, continue
the whip as normal.

#### Handshake reverse whip

Start in a [handshake] hold. Lead an [L-hook] between the 1 and 2. The follower
should be facing 12 o'clock by the end of 2. On 3& take your sweet time making
sure you get into a proper [starter] position and placing your right wrist under
the follower's armpit such that there is no gap. On 4 step across the slot and
propel the follower forward across the slot, not in an orbiting motion. Step 5
is down the slot towards 12 o'clock, step 6 is across the slot towards 9
o'clock, not diagonally, and steps 7&8 are an anchor step. You should end in a
[open] position.

#### Left shoulder-lock reverse whip

Start in a [left shoulder-lock] position. Steps 1 and 2 are backwards diagonally
such that you should face 3 o'clock by the end of step 2. On step 3& you enter
[starter] position, and on steps 4 through 8 you lead a regular whip. You should
end in [open] position.

For the handwork, pull the follower toward 6 o'clock on 1 using your left arm.
Then invert the curvature of your right wrist on the follower's shoulder between
1 and 2 to indicate a 0.5 counter-clockwise turn to the follower. The follower
should be facing 12 o'clock by the end of 2. Your right hand should not lose
contact throughout the turn because the follower does not know how much to turn.
Between 1.5 and the end of 2 you will nee to turn your hand while maintaining
contact. Your right hand fingers will basically from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock
counter-clockwise before your palm can turn and be placed on the follower's left
shoulder.

#### Pass-through whip

It is similar to a [car-wash whip]. It requires a [goofy] handhold. In steps 1
and 2 raise your right hand over her head, in steps 3 and 4 bring your right
hand to your lower back as to create tension and cause the follower to do a
clockwise turn. If you place your right hand on your right hip as opposed to
your lower back, then the follower will have no option but to rotate clockwise
because your hip will push against her hand and prevent her from turning
counter-clockwise. Step 4 is a regular whip step, but 5 isn't. Step 5 does not
have any rotation. Simply place your right foot next to your left foot. Step 6
requires your left foot to step back so you go into the slot. In steps 7&8 you
are also stepping backward into the slot and offering your hand. At the end you
should be in [open] position.

#### Behind-the-back whip

Use it from an [open] position. On step 1 step back and to the left such that
left foot points at 9:00 counter-clockwise. On step 2, close your feet so your
whole body points at 9:00. When doing the hand switch on 2, rotate your right
hand into a [weird] position and place her right palm on your left wrist, which
will facility her hand to slide down into a behind-the-back handshake position.
On step 3, offer your left hand at either waist level pointing at 8 o'clock
relative to your body with your palm pointing up or at neck level pointing at 2
o'clock relative to your body. On 3&4 step backwards towards 3:00 while facing
9:00. Steps 5, 6, 7&8 are normal, as in, 5 is forward at 12 o'clock and 6 is to
the left at 9 o'clock. You should end in a [scout] position.

#### Apache whip

Not to be confused with the [behind-the-back whip].

Start in an [open] position. Same on 1 and 2, but on 3 and 4 you put the
follower's right hand behind her lower back and grab her right hand with your
right hand into a [weird handshake].
[Watch video.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fVUUG6ny4vI&pp=ygUbd2VzdCBjb2FzdCBzd2luZyB3ZWlyZCB3aGlw)

Paraphrased advice from Damon D'Amico:

When performing an Apache whip, in addition to always keeping the right hand on
the follower's shoulder, the hand switch happens on 5, not 4. If you attempt the
hand switch on 4, you are undermining the follower. On 5, do not take your right
hand off the follower's back to perform the hand switch because this is
confusing for the follower. On 5, for the hand switch, while the right hand is
pressed against the follower's left shoulder blade and the right wrist is under
the armpit with no gap, all you have to do is change the direction of your right
hand from 9 o'clock to 6 o'clock while lifting your right-hand fingers, assuming
the imaginary clock is mounted on the follower's back. Then bring the follower's
right hand under those fingers using your left hand.

#### Continuous whip

Do a regular whip, then on 3& you should be in a [starter] position with your
left foot free to step across on 4. On 4 step across with your foot pointing at
9 o'clock, not 12 o'clock, so on 5 you can use your right foot to propel
yourself on a 0.5 clockwise turn so your body, face, and feet face 3 o'clock. It
is very important to perform steps 4 and 5 as a single, fluid motion. Then keep
stepping across, as if repeating steps 4 and 5, alternating between facing 9
o'clock and 3 o'clock. Make sure that you are not making an orbiting motion. You
should be stepping across the slot, and the follower should be moving up and
down the slot, kind of like the + sign, as opposed to orbiting around the slot,
like a circle O. As you are stepping across the slot, make sure there is tension
on the 4 such that the tension directs the follower to move across the slot, not
around the slot. Also, on 4 both will be very closed together whereas on 5 there
should be a little bit of a stretch as the tension builds up before the next 4
and 5. To finish the pattern, stop creating tension on step 5 while the follower
is in closed position, and slowly release the follower's left shoulder blade
into [open] position as you step across the slot on 6 so your body and feet can
point either 12 o'clock or 6 o'clock depending on how many turns you did. Then
7&8 are a regular anchor step. You should end in an [open] position.

Note that the repetition ends on the odd beat 5 because the settling happens on
the even beat 6.

One of the main uses of the continuous whip is to add 2-beat increments so that
you are more easily able to predict or approach the 8th beat in the song.

#### Continuous whip into starter position

Start in an [open] position. Then go into a [continuous whip] after 3& or the
first 5. Then settle on 6 to go into a [starter] position.

The perpendicular angle is very important when stepping across on 4. Keep
repeating 4 and 5 in one quick, smooth motion, like the 4 and 5 are one motion,
not two steps, making sure to maintain this perpendicular shape at the end of
each rotation on 5, and making sure the follower moves up and down the slot, not
in a circular or orbiting fashion. On the last repeat of the 4 and 5, do not
build tension on the 5, become gooey on 6 so the follower can settle, and should
end in [starter] position on 6.

Next pattern suggestion:

- Do a [left-side starter inside chain turn into open position] because most
  followers should be able to follow, and there is something about the angle
  that makes it feel good.
- [left-side starter back-lead free-spin], which is an intermediate exit.
- [left-side outside pass]
- [left-side starter outside turn into a weird handshake position] and a
  [handshake reverse whip]

#### Continuous basket whip into starter position

Do a basket whip, then on 4 and 5 lead a [continuous whip], an settle in a
[starter] position on 6.

#### Whip with two outside turns into over-rotated open position

Start in a [open] position. The footwork and handwork are exactly the same as a
[whip with an outside turn] up to an including step 6. A common error is to
begin leading the outside turn before 6 rather than at the end of 6. Perform a
whip with two outside turns. On 7 step forward towards 12 o'clock such that your
right foot points at 3 o'clock while leading one full outside pivot turn with
the left hand, on 8 lead another outside pivot turn while you turn to face 3
o'clock. You should end in an over-rotated [open] position because you face 3
o'clock as opposed to 12 o'clock and because the follower face 9 o'clock instead
of 6 o'clock.

Next pattern suggestions:

- [shadow position into sweetheart into scout handhold] Note that steps 7, 8,
  and 1 should be done in one fluid motion to maintain angular momentum.

#### Whip ride

A leader cannot lead a ride, but he can strongly coax the follower onto a ride.
In a ride, the follower stands on one leg as the lead walks around her while
maintaining a closed position, causing her to rotate in place. Maintaining
balance is very difficult for the follower. Both the lead and the follower must
know what they are doing.

By not being able to lead a ride, I mean to say that there is nothing that the
lead can do to prevent the follower from simply opting to walk in a rotating
fashion as opposed to standing on one leg.

The handwork and footwork is the same as in a regular whip up to but not
including 3&. In a regular whip, 3& are done in place on the left side of the
slot while facing 3 o'clock. When doing a ride, the & step in the 3& is
progressive toward 3 o'clock because step 4 must be on the right side of the
slot, with your body pointing somewhere between 3:00 and 4:30 o'clock, signaling
the follower that we are about to go into a ride. Note that the leader must grab
the right hand with this left hand for improved balance, and the right hand must
be placed on the follower's teres major, at the top of the armpit, and on the
shoulder blade. The right-hand elbow should be locked straight. Every step after
the 4 must be a half-step. In other words, 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8, as opposed to 4 5
6 7 8. Short, shuffling, smooth, fast steps are better for balance than single
1-beat steps. Make sure not the push or pull the follower off-balance. She is
merely using your right arm as a rest while you both rotate. You are providing
angular momentum with your right arm, but not pushing or pulling, just holding.

### Redirects

A redirect has a tension and a compression component, just like a sugar push.

#### Right-side pass redirect

Start from an [open] position. Step back on 1 and 2 to get out of the slot and
face 3:00 while raising your left hand to the follower's right side of her head;
step slightly to the left to encourage the follower to take the slot but do not
step out of the slot completely. On 3&4, create a compression with your left
hand while leading the follower through an inside rotation. Also put your right
hand on the followers right-side ribs and slightly push her towards 12:00 to
redirect her. Step forward on 4 and face 12:00. On 5&6, anchor step. End in an
[open] position.

#### Right-side pass redirect to starter

The same as a [right-side pass redirect], but on 5&6 you step forward
progressively to close the distance with the follower and end in a [starter]
position.

Quickly going from facing 3:00 to 9:00 makes this pattern look dynamic.

#### Closed right-side pass redirect

Start in a [closed] position. On step 1 step back and to the left towards 7:30.
Also, on 1, raise your left hand to follower head-height. On 2, step towards
6:00 with your right foot such that your toes point at 3:00 to open the slot. On
2, raise your left hand and look at your imaginary watch in preparation to lead
an inside turn. Make left hand fingers point at 3:00 to tell the follower it
will be an inside turn. On 3&4, triple step while facing 3:00 and use your left
hand to draw a counter-clockwise halo over the follower's head and immediately
lower your left hand to her waist level; the follower will do exactly one
counter-clockwise turn. At the same time on 3&4, lower your right hand from her
left shoulder blade to waist level and apply force with your right forearm
towards 12:00 to lead her back towards 12:00; the forearm is a barrier that
prevents her from walking towards 6:00; if you do not lower your right arm, your
forearm will run across her chest; a common mistake on 3 is to take of the right
hand from the follower's back and then try to use the right hand to redirect the
follower towards 12:00; there is not enough time to use the hand, so the best
thing to do is to lower the right arm while maintaining contact and using the
forearm for the redirect, not the palm. On 5&6, anchor step. End in an [open]
position.

For the follower, step 4 should be towards 12 o'clock so the 5&6 can be a proper
anchor.

#### Starter left-side pass redirect

Start in a [starter] position. On 1, step back and to the left towards 4:30 with
your left foot; move out of the slot for the follower to walk through; face 9:00
while standing with your feet apart in split weight. On 2 shift your weight onto
your left foot and raise your left hand and the follower's right hand to her
face level as a prep for an inside turn; move slightly diagonally to the right
on 1 and 2 to encourage the follower to move into the slot but do not move
totally out of the slot; on 1 and 2 the follower will pass pas your left
shoulder, do not cut her travel short. On 3 move your weight onto your right
leg. On 4 bring your left foot next to your right foot while facing 9:00. You
may choose to do a cross or a hook step as long as your weight ends on the left
foot. For the handwork, on 3 and 4 (or 3&4 for the follower) use your left hand
to lead an inside turn while using your right hand, which is placed between in
the groove between the followers shoulder blades, to apply force to pull the
follower back into the 12:00 direction; left hand is mostly for show. On 5&6,
the follower will do an anchor step while facing 6:00 and you should be back in
[starter] position.

### Dips

#### Piston into dip

On 1 and 2 do a [piston] like in a [single-arm turn-in]. The step 2 is backwards
with the right leg and the right leg should be ready to support your full weight
and her weight, so position it in a stable position. On 3 and 4 put your arms
under her arms such that your forearms (palmaris longi) are placed flat under
and across the middle of her triceps long heads. Always keep your arms as
parallel as possible and perpendicular to your body, and do not put your
forearms under her armpits as not to invade her personal space. On 3, bend your
right knee to initiate the dip. The knee on your left leg should not be bent; it
should be locked. On 4 hold the dip. On 5 and 6 stand back up and lead the
follower on a 180 deg clockwise turn into open position. On 7&8 do an anchor
step.

#### Left side inside chain turn to dip into starter position.

This is an 6 beat pattern elongated into an 8 beat pattern because the anchor
step is 4 beats to allow the follower to go into closed position. The actual dip
happens on beat 5.

Start from an [open] position. Lead a left-side inside chain turn up to step 4.
On this pattern you are facing 9 o'clock on steps 4 thru 8.

For the footwork, you always stay on the left side of the slot. This means that
you do not step across on step 4, instead. On 5 and 6 you don't do any footwork.
You must stand up straight with split weight on your feet. If anything, there
should be a little bit more weight on you right leg because the follower is
going to dip to the left. Be extremely careful that you are not using your arms
to encourage or push the follower into the dip. In the contrary, you should be
preemptively provide resistance to your right. Do not add any force towards the
direction in which the follower is dipping. It could be catastrophic. Instead
preemptively apply force in the opposite direction in which the follower is
dipping. This is specially important whenever you are holding the follower by
the waist and the right shoulder. It is easy to try to use your hands to
encourage the follower into a dip, but do not do that. It is up to the follower
to dip as much or as little as she wants.

After the dip, the follower should be looking at 12 o'clock and you should be
perpendicular, looking at 9 o'clock.

The dip happens on 5, the follower begins to stand up on 6, and then on 7 8 you
shift your weight onto your right foot while the follower does a 0.5 turn
clockwise as you "unwind" her from your right arm. At this point you should be
in a [starter] position.

From here you can step across as if doing a continuous whip and repeating steps
4 and 5 of a continuous whip. Then stop doing continuous whips and signal this
by relaxing your arms and allowing the follower to settle. Then do a inside
chain turn from [starter] position.

### Lifts

These patterns require leaving the floor while being supported or being thrown
into an airborne state.

I have yet to learn one of these patterns.

### Triple-step replacements

Triple steps are the default footwork for steps 3&4 and 5&6 in 6-beat patterns
and for steps 3&4 and 7&8 in 8-beat patterns.

On March 2024, Houston, I took a workshop at the Novice Invitational dance event
and learned about replacing triple steps with level changes. Months later,
[Chuck Anders] introduced me to the concept of the anchor wheel, and how the
anchor triple-step can be replaced with a side-, a front-, or a back-check.

The anchor wheel describes the anchor step variations that can be applied to
anchor steps in sugar pushes, left-side passes, right-side passes, and whips.

Then, I took a styling class with [Zach and Rachel] and learned about replacing
triple steps with tap steps, slides, and holding the beat (or eating the beat,
jocosely speaking).

In other words, it looks like any triple step can be replaced with any step
variation that is 2 beat in length, and all anchor steps can additionally be
elongated from 2 to 4 beats. Elongating the steps makes more sense in faster
songs because elongating an anchor step to a slow song will feel unnatural.

The number of triple-step replacements should be infinite, but this is an
attempt to standardize some steps because as my dad says, "[one should]
formalize [one's] thoughts".

The easiest way to practice triple-step replacements is to add a triple-step or
anchor variation in every single sugar push, left-side pass, right-side pass,
and whip.

#### Improved anchor step

Damon D'Amico taught me this.

This is a stylized version of the regular triple-step anchor step. You should be
able to use it all the time instead of a regular anchor step.

At the end of an anchor, the follower's hips should be pointing slightly to the
left because the weight is on the left foot and the right foot is on front. The
follower should not square her hips on step 1. The follower should square the
hips on step 2 unless there is a prep. For example, a left prep will move the
hips to the right. On the 5&6, the follower may choose to move slightly to the
left and to allow the movement to lead the follower to settle on the left hip
with the hips pointing slightly to the left, at 11 o'clock. The lady should make
sure to close her hips on step 1 if taking a step forward would result on a big
un-lady-like gap.

The leader should do the anchor step such that the hips point slightly to the
right at 1 o'clock. Also, on the 1, the right foot big toe and the middle toe
should make contact, but not the third toe, before stepping back with the left
foot. Steps 1 and 2 should be with open legs, like you are straddling over a
puddle, or like your balls are so big you couldn't close your legs even if you
wanted.

Whenever you square your hips, you walk out of an anchor step looking like an I.
The goal is to look like a K or a Ʞ.

#### Slide

A slide is different from a sweep because a sweep does not require your to build
momentum by lifting your free leg and standing on the ball of your other foot.
Also, a sweep is a circular clockwise or counter-clockwise motion, whereas a
slide is unidirectional.

There are at least 10 general ways in which you can slide, with 5 ways for each
foot.

Starting with both feet together facing at 12 o-clock, you can jump on the ball
of your right foot without becoming airborne so you can gain momentum as your
left foot slides to 12, 10:30, 9, 7:30 or 6 o-clock.

Likewise, starting with both feet together facing at 12 o-clock, you can jump on
the ball of your left foot without becoming airborne so you can gain momentum as
your left foot slides to 12, 1:30, 3, 4:30 or 6 o-clock.

For styling, your body and foot can be perpendicular to the direction of travel.
For example, if you step toward 12 with your left foot, then your body and left
foot can point at 3 o'clock. If step toward 12 with your right foot, then your
right foot and body can point at 9 o'clock. As another example, your body and
feet can point at 10:30 if you are traveling to either 7:30 or 1:30 o'clock
because 10:30 is perpendicular to the direction of travel.

#### Level change

A level change, like a level up or a level down, means standing on your tippy
toes or bending your knees to increase or decrease your height by a couple of
inches.

Stand on the balls of your feet to increase your stature by about 2 inches.

Bend your knees slightly to decrease your stature by about 2 inches.

#### Level up on first triple

On a left-side pass or a right-side pass, perform the steps 3&4 such that steps
3& are raised. On 4 you go back to a normal level as you step into the slot.

#### Level up on second triple

On a sugar push perform the anchor step such that the 5& are raised so step 6 is
in place and brings you down to a regular level.

On a whip it would be 7&.

#### Level down on first triple

On a left-side pass or a right-side pass, do the 3&4 such that you bend your
knees on 3& and go back to normal on step 4 as you step on the slot.

#### Level down on second triple

On a left-side pass or a right-side pass, do the 5&6 such that you bend your
knees on 5& and go back to normal on step 6 as you step on the slot.

On a whip it would be 7&.

#### Cross-legged outside turn

A weird 180 degree cross-legged turn that Rachel taught me. Bend your left leg
so there is a 70 degree angle in the posterior part of your left knee. Then
cross your right leg behind your left leg such that your right knee touches the
back of your left knee. Then turn around 180 degrees while pivoting on your legs
such that your left knee touches the back of your right knee. You can reduce the
amount you bend your knees by lowering the "cross-point" from your knees to your
shins.

#### Cross-legged inside turn

Also known as a cross-legged inside turn.

A weird 180 degree cross-legged turn that Rachel taught me. Bend your right leg
so there is a 70 degree angle in the posterior part of your right knee. Then
cross your left leg behind your right leg such that your left knee touches the
back of your right knee. Then turn around 180 degrees while pivoting on your
legs such that your right knee touches the back of your left knee. You can
reduce the amount you bend your knees by lowering the "cross-point" from your
knees to your shins.

#### Hitch

Usually in a sugar push or side-pass you settle on your right leg and then step
backwards twice on the 1 and 2. In a hitch step you settle on your right leg,
but the weight is not on the ball of your foot or the middle of the foot, it is
on the heel. The only way not to lose balance is to change your pitch forward,
meaning your chest goes slightly forward while your hips go slightly backward.
Your left foot should feel like it is floating because there is so little weight
on it on the 1. Then on the &2 you quickly change weight onto your left leg
before changing the weight back again onto your right leg. This steps fits blues
well because blues is swung, but it may feel syncopated to a song that is not
swung.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqYQROF7vw4)

#### Brush

A brush step is different from a sweep because it does not have a rotating
motion about the hip. A brush is also different from a slide because a slide is
a progressive move, whereas a brush is an stationary move that resembles a kick.

This pattern takes 2 beats. The pawing takes 1 beat, and the kicking and coming
back to a stable stance takes 1 beat.

A brush in the backward is identical to a bull pawing the ground because you
drag your foot backwards against the floor before the friction with the floor is
lost and you end up kicking back into the air because your hamstring is still
contracting. For stability and styling, it is best to change your body's pitch
forward on 1, meaning your hips should go slightly back while your chest goes
forward. On 2 you undo the pitch, which you can style it as a body roll.

A brush to the left with the left leg or to the right with the right leg also
looks similar as in the backwards direction. Your drag the ball of your foot
against the floor to the right or to the left on 1, the traction with the floor
is lost and the kick happens on 2, and returning to a stable position also
happens at the end of 2. You also change your body's pitch, meaning that if you
are using your right leg to brush to the left, then your chest will lean
slightly to the left as your hips move slightly to the right on 1. On 2 you undo
the pitch by smoothly contracting your right-side rib muscles to do a body roll.

You can probably brush to the left and to the right with either leg.

A brush forward is different from a brush backward or to the side because it
looks like a kick that goes back a couple of inches in the air (winding up) and
brushes the floor as it goes forward looking as a kick. Again, the kick happens
on 1 and returning to place happens on 2 while the foot is in mid air. This time
the pitch goes back on 1, meaning the chest goes slightly backwards while the
hips go forwards. The pitch is undone on 2 by styling it like body roll with the
forward going forward and the chest following it before the hips go back to
place.

#### Front-check

Also known as a cross-step.

Instead of stepping in place for the & step, step on front of your left foot
with with your right foot.

#### Back-check

Also known as a hook-step.

Instead of stepping in place for the & step, step behind your left foot with
with your right foot.

#### Right side-check

Instead of stepping in place for the & step, step to the right, outside the
slot, with your right foot.

#### Left side-check

Instead of stepping in place for the & step, step to the left, outside the slot,
with your left foot.

#### Counter-clockwise sweep

A rond de jambe.

Instead of doing the anchor step for a duration of 2 beats, slide your right
foot from 6, to 3, to 12 o'clock in a round motion and go back to 6 o'clock.

Pattern suggestion:

- On a [left-side pass], replace steps 5&6 with a sweep.

#### Slow counter-clockwise sweep

A rond de jambe.

Mechanically the same as a counter-clockwise sweep, but with a duration of 4
beats instead of 2.

#### Clockwise sweep

A rond de jambe.

Instead of doing the anchor step for a duration of 2 beats, slide your right
foot from 12, to 3, to 6 o'clock in a round motion.

Pattern suggestion:

- On a [right-side inside turn], replace steps 5&6 with a sweep.

#### Slow clockwise sweep

A rond de jambe.

Mechanically the same as a clockwise sweep, but with a duration of 4 beats
instead of 2.

#### Clockwise taps

Instead of doing the anchor step for a duration of 2 beats, do 4 taps for a
duration of 4 beats. The taps will be at 12, 2, 4, and 6 o'clock.

#### Counter-clockwise taps

Instead of doing the anchor step for a duration of 2 beats, do 4 taps for a
duration of 4 beats. The taps will be at 6, 3, 12, and 6 o'clock.
