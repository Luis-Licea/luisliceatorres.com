## General

There are 6 strings on a standard electric guitar. The strings represent notes e, A, D, G, B, and E, where the lower-case e represents the thick, low-pitched string. 
The mnemonic device I use to remember the order is "eat garbage", which somehows maps to "eED G(ar)B(ag)E" in my brain. While "eat goobie" is shorter, I can't remember it.

There are at least 21 frets on a standard electric guitar. 
The frets are numbered 0 through 21, where 0 means the string is played open, and 1 means the string is played while pressing the fret closest to the tunning pegs and furthest away from the guitar body.

## Note idiosyncrasies

In my notes, the letter S is a placeholder that represents all the \[s\]tring guitars notes e, A, D, G, B, and E in a generic, fomulaic, and algebraic way.

I describe note locations using X-Y coordinate notation, where X represents the fret number and Y represents the note. For example, the coordinate (0,A) or 0A represents playing the open A string.

## S5 chords

All the S5 chord root notes are located on the first 6 frets on strings e and A.
The root notes are 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 0e, 1e, 2e, 3e, and 4e. These root notes represent A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, and G#, respectively.

Interistingly, the notes A and #A appear twice. Once at A0 and 1A, and again at 5e and 6e.
Use 0A and 1A as the root notes. I have yet to come up with rationale for this, but it probably has to do with the A, B, C, D, E, F, G note progression, meaning that the A y-coordinate should be picked first.

Also interestingly, none of the root notes are located on the D, G, B, or E strings.
