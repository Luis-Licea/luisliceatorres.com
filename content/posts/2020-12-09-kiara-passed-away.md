Kiara died December 9, 2020 at 12:30 AM while being at the backyard by herself.
I was the last one to see her alive. She was about 13 years of age.

I woke up that morning and fed her a lemon pepper chicken leg after rubbing her
belly. She had not been eating properly for the last few days so I was happy
that she ate the chicken leg. I wanted her to chew the chicken leg bone, but
surprisingly, she only licked it once and then stopped. She then walked through
the dog door to the backyard.

Hours later Esmeralda saw Kiara lying on the concrete, so we placed Kiara in a
cardboard box and left her outside because I had two final exams the same day,
one at 1PM and the other at 4PM. I only got to bury her after that.

I began to dig a hole 3 feet deep. The whole was finished the next day at about
1PM. Kiara's box was placed in the hole. Her Christmas sweater, a red rose, a
written letter containing a message from Esmeralda, and another letter
containing a message from myself were placed inside the box along with Kiara.

The box was closed and a rose was put on top of the box. The hole was then
filled. On the letter, I wrote "Te amo mucho Kiara. Nos vemos en el cielo."
