## General

In Lindy Hop, like in [Charleston], steps 1 and 2 involve rocking backward and
forward, with step 1 being a left-foot step backwards.

## Handholds

### Left-to-right

Your left hand and the follower's right hand should be connected like a towel on
a bar, meaning the follower's hand should be hanging on the lead's left hand.
The arms should be relaxed as if they were rubber bands attached at the
shoulders and hands.

## Positions

### Closed position

Stand in an L position, perpendicular to the follower. Your right hand should be
placed on the follower's middle back, not around the waist because this may
prevent the follower from turning and because it feels creepy. This is not
ballroom hold in the slightest.

### Left-to-right closed position

Same as in a [closed position], but with a [left-to-right] handhold.

### Open position

You stand in front of the follower with a [left-to-right] hand connection.

## Patterns

### Basic

Step back on 1 with the left leg. Step forward on 2 with the right leg. Steps 1
and 2 are a rock step. Steps 3&4 are a triple step forward with the left leg.
Steps 5&6 are a triple step backward with the right leg.

### Swing out

Start in a [starter position]. Do a rock stop. Back with left foot (1), front
with right foot (2), and then step forward with your left foot to do a triple
step (3&4) while leaning your body forward and using your right arm to lead the
follower forward. You can signal the open position by extending your right hand
fingers relative to your palm, freeing her waist and allowing her to move
forward. Steps 5&6 are triple step with the right leg moving backwards.

You should end in an [open position].

### Basic break

Start in a [left-to-right closed position]. On 1 and 2 do a 2-beat rock-step. On
3 stomp solidly into the floor with your left leg on 3, while leaning your body
forwards. On 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shake your hips forwards and backwards.

## Lindy Hop sequences
