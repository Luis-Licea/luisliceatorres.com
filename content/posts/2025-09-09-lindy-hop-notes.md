## General

In Lindy Hop, steps 1 and 2 involve rocking backward and forward, with step 1
being a left-foot step backwards.

## Lindy Hop

### Positions

#### Closed position

Stand in L position, perpendicular to the follower, such that your left hand and
her right hand are connected like a towel, meaning her hand should be hanging on
a bar, your hand. Your right hand should be at belly-button level. Your right
hand should be placed on the follower's middle back, not around the waist
because this may prevent the follower from turning and because it feels creepy.
This is not ballroom hold in the slightest.

The footwork is the same as in a [basic].

#### Open position

You stand in front of the follower with a left-to-right hand connection.

### Patterns

#### Basic

Step back on 1 with the left leg. Step forward on 2 with the right leg. Steps 1
and 2 are a rock step. Steps 3&4 are a triple step forward with the left leg.
Steps 5&6 are a triple step backward with the right leg.

#### Swing out

Start in a [closed position]. Do a rock stop. Back with left foot (1), front
with right foot (2), and then step forward with your left foot to do a triple
step (3&4) while leaning your body forward and using your right arm to lead the
follower forward. You can signal the open position by extending your right hand
fingers relative to your palm, freeing her waist and allowing her to move
forward. Steps 5&6 are triple step with the right leg moving backwards.

You should end in an [open position].

#### Basic break

Start in a [closed position]. On 1 and 2 do a 2-beat rock-step. On 3 stomp
solidly into the floor with your left leg on 3, while leaning your body
forwards. On 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shake your hips forwards and backwards.
