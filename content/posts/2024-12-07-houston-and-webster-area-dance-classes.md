## [Salsa Eddy] | \$20/day

The class price depends on how long the class is, and whether you are a walk-in
or you have an appointment. Either way, the price is not bad, and Eddy is such a
good instructor! If you are new to Salsa, you may want to take Salsa on 1 before
you take Salsa on 2.

## [Dance Vision Studio] | ðŸ’°/class

For me, each private lesson was about \$120. However, the membership allows you
to attend group classes for free. If you take advantage of every single free
group class and you schedule your private lessons two weeks apart, the average
price per session could be \$30. If you only take private classes, then it is
virtually the same as paying \$120 per class. As far as private dance lesson
prices go, \$120 per lesson is a reasonable price.

Private lessons are done via appointment, and group lessons are spread out
regularly throughout the week.

I would recommend these guys if you have an important dance coming up, like a
wedding dance or a competitive dance.

## [Fred Astaire] | ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°/month

The place looked like a very elegant establishment, suggesting the private
lessons would be more expensive than in [Dance Vision Studio]. If you take
advantage of every single free group class, the average price per session will
also drop, but [Fred Astaire] seem to offer fewer group classes than [Dance
Vision Studio].

Anecdotally, I have heard that [Fred Astaire] caters to competitive dancers who
may spend from \$1,000 to \$5,000 per month in lesson fees. I did not get a
quote, so take this anecdote with a grain of salt. Casual dancers will probably
get charged much less.

I would recommend these guys if have a very important dance coming up, like a
wedding dance or a competitive dance.
