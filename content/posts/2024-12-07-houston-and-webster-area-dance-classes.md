## [The Chute] | \$10/day

No classes are given here, but it is a decent place for line dancing and social
dancing two-step, cumbia, norteÃ±o, and occasionally bachata.

The best days to go, from best to worst, based on how full the place will be,
are:

- Thursdays (about 80 people)
- Wednesdays (about 20 people)
- Sundays (about 5 people)

## [The Hangar]

I have never been here, but it seems like the best place to learn 2-step.

| Time        | Tuesday | Wednesday     | Thursday                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Not Set** | 2-Step  | 2-Step, Waltz | Cha-Cha, West Coast Swing |

Check the schedule for exact class times. The schedule is listed in the
[texasdancecountry.com] website. Note that the site does not have HTTPS, so it
is sketchy.

## [Bay Area Whip Dance Club] | \$100/year

The yearly membership is $100. That is very cheap! The classes take place inside
the [Walter Hall Banquet Hall].

| Time   | Tuesday          |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 7:15PM | West Coast Swing |

## [Zach and Rachel] | \$25/class

| 6:45PM | West Coast Swing Beginner Foundations or Continuing Basics |
| 7:30PM | West Coast Swing International Rally Choreography          |

## [High Horse Saloon] | \$20/day

No classes are given here, but it is great place for line-dancing or dancing to
country music. If you want to dance, you have to bring a partner, though, as
most people who go there are couples. You can even dance to live country music!
Sundays are good days to go.

## [The Palladium] | \$20/day

On Fridays, Palladium teaches Salsa and Bachata on different rooms. The salsa
classes are always beginner classes and do not have enough people for couple
dancing. The Bachata classes are packed and have enough people for couple
dances.

{{< alert >}} **Warning!** Drop-ins are welcome on Fridays and weekends! All the
other days require you to sign up! {{< /alert >}}

## [Salsa Eddy] | \$20/day

The class price depends on how long the class is, and whether you are a walk-in
or you have an appointment. Either way, the price is not bad, and Eddy is such a
good instructor! If you are new to Salsa, you may want to take Salsa on 1 before
you take Salsa on 2.

## [Dance Vision Studio] | ðŸ’°/class

Every 4th Sunday there is a \$10 West Coast Swing workshop with world-renowned
people.

For me, each private lesson was about \$120. However, the membership allows you
to attend group classes for free. If you take advantage of every single free
group class and you schedule your private lessons two weeks apart, the average
price per session could be \$30. If you only take private classes, then it is
virtually the same as paying \$120 per class. As far as private dance lesson
prices go, \$120 per lesson is a reasonable price.

Private lessons are done via appointment, and group lessons are spread out
regularly throughout the week.

I would recommend these guys if you have an important dance coming up, like a
wedding dance or a competitive dance.

## [Fred Astaire] | ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°/month

The place looked like a very elegant establishment, suggesting the private
lessons would be more expensive than in [Dance Vision Studio]. If you take
advantage of every single free group class, the average price per session will
also drop, but [Fred Astaire] seem to offer fewer group classes than [Dance
Vision Studio].

Anecdotally, I have heard that [Fred Astaire] caters to competitive dancers who
may spend from \$1,000 to \$5,000 per month in lesson fees. I did not get a
quote, so take this anecdote with a grain of salt. Casual dancers will probably
get charged much less.

I would recommend these guys if have a very important dance coming up, like a
wedding dance or a competitive dance.
