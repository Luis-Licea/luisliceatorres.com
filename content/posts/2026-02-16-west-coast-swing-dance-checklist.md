- Smile
- Interpret the lyrics.
- Interpret the instruments (bouncy, smooth, or detached beats).
- Count down beats (to hit 1's, phrase changes)
- Align thumbs and forearms in a straight line and bend middle and ring fingers
  to create a nice platform for the follower, like shaking someone's hand.
- Do full weight changes by settling slightly on hips:
  - To slow down weight transfer, stand with feet apart at shoulder width.
  - Do not slide feet on even beets. The replace step must happen in place.
  - Do drop steps on 3 of sugar push and side passes.
- Keep elbows bent so they stay at or behind rib cage, not past it.
- Angle body at 2:00 to create stretch when anchoring.
  - Square up on the one and pull shoulder back into un-stretched position to
    "jerk" follower.
  - Stretch shoulder on the & of the &1 of a new pattern.
- Practice choreography.
- Practice engaging lats.
  - Create opposition on every step by contracting latissimus dorsi backwards
    when stepping backward, or engaging shoulder forward when moving forward.
    Only contract lat once in a triple step, not three times. Contract the lat
    that is opposite to the free leg when walking backward.
  - A side wave will not work because it requires bending the knees or changing
    levels, which will not work well with side passes or whips.

## Sugar push

Using arms and left leg as a spring during a sugar push. Do not stop follower
immediately on 3. Catch on 2 and slowly absorb on 3. Be a pillow, not a wall. On
1, when squaring up from the stretch, speed up follower and catch her right hand
on 2, then absorb the momentum.
