## Patterns

Location and orientation of movement can be described using Cartesian, airplane,
or spherical units:

- XYZ(left and right, up and down, in and out)
- PYR(pitch, yaw, roll)
- RTP(radius, theta, phi)
  - All joints use spherical coordinates (Radius, Theta, Phi). Radius can be a
    percentage, inches, or 0 if it does not make sense. Theta and Phi are in
    degrees.

A body T-posing with an expressionless face represents the neutral position. If
a body part is not described, assume it is in neutral position, meaning all
values and location and orientation values are 0.

All the movable parts:

- head (neck) has X, Z, P, R, W
- shoulder in Y, Z
- chest: X, Z, P, R, W

1. The direction of the movement (or gesture). Use clock time.
2. The part of the body doing the movement:

   - left, right hand
     - pinky
     - ring
     - middle
     - index
     - thumb
   - left, right wrist
   - left, right forearm
   - left, right elbow
   - left, right arm
   - left, right shoulder
   - left, right hip
   - left, right leg
   - left, right knee
   - left, right foreleg
   - left, right ankle
   - left, right foot
     - ball
     - pinky
     - ring
     - middle
     - index
     - thumb
   - lower spine (abdominal and lower-back muscles engage lower spine and hips)
   - thoracic spine (lats engage thoracic spine)
   - neck
   - head (neck muscles engage head)
     - eyes
     - mouth
     - eyebrows
     - forehead

3. The distance of movement:

   - feet:
     - tiny:
     - small:
     - normal: 18in
     - big:
     - huge:
   - shoulders:
     - small: half an inch
     - normal: one inch
     - big: 2 inch
     - huge: 3inc
   - torso:
   - hip
   - knees
   - elbows

4. The level of the movement:
   - arm:
     - highest: 90 deg below parallel
     - high: 45 deg above parallel
     - middle: parallel to floor
     - low: 45 deg below parallel
     - lowest: 90 deg below parallel
   - leg:
     - 90 deg below parallel
     - 45 deg above parallel
     - parallel to floor
     - 45 deg below parallel
     - 90 deg below parallel
5. The duration of the movement (or hold):
   - 1 beat
   - 0.5 beat
   - 0.25 beat
   - 0.125 beat
6. The type of motion in the direction of movement:
   - linear
   - legato
   - staccato
   - impact-rebound

The following animations are not perfect, but they should be conceptually
helpful.

## Open position to hip catch

Start: open position.

Upbeat:

0% - %100:

- left hand:
  - ring RTP(80%, 90, 0)
  - middle (same as ring)
- right hand:
- left, right wrist: same
-
- feet: take a fast, momentous step back with left foot at 7:30, out of the
  slot.
- arm: Do not use left bicep to pull the follower. The arm must be relaxed.
  There must be a lot of tension.
- core: rotate your core clockwise to face 2:00.
- feet: step back with right foot at 7:30 so you are straddling with split
  weight. Resist the urge to settle on right leg.

Downbeat:

- core: face 3:00.

  2.arm: the left arm draws half of counter-clockwise halo over the follower so
  she turns counter-clockwise and faces 3:00 and then release the left-right
  hand connection. At the same time raise your right arm to follower waist level
  and to your shoulder width to catch the follower's hip.

  1.feet: Remain straddled. The follower will go into a straddle position to
  face 3:00.

  1.hands: Catch the follower's waist, not the hip, using left hand. There
  should be no left-right hand connection.

  1.core: Remain facing 3:00.

  1.spacing: you must be in a shadow position such that your right shoulder is
  behind her right shoulder so she can see you with her peripheral vision. Don't
  stand directly behind her.

  1.face: look at the follower because she needs visual cues.
