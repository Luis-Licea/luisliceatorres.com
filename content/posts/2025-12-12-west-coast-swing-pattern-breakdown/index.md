The goal is to break each pattern into two-beat increments so that accentuating
phrase changes, which happen on odd beats, is possible. Counting turns on the
analytical part of the brain, so numbers will not be used to count the steps in
the pattern. Just listen to the music, or if necessary, count the music beats,
not the pattern steps.

## Competition tips

If your face is stone cold without making eye contact, you will be perceived as
less confident, less sure of yourself, or hiding something, meaning you will be
graded more critically. Your smile is part of how your dance is perceived.
Having a stone-cold face also makes your partner feel more critical of your
dance and her own dance. It is an overall unpleasant experience.

Smiling will let the judges be more forgiving of your mistakes. Smile, look at
your partner, and enjoy every moment.

Dancing competitively is a visual sport, so judges can only judge what they see
during your performance. Judges are not supposed to use previous knowledge of
your dancing even if they dance with you before competing.

### Strictly dances

Every dance is judged like it is a final, meaning that the leader and follow are
judged as a couple.

### Jack-and-Jill

In Jack-and-Jill prelims and semi-finals, the leader and the follow are judged
individually. Because the judge only looks at you for 8 seconds, your dance must
be extremely busy, full of quality motion. Be repetitive because you will only
be judged a few seconds and you do not know when that will be. In other words,
do basics, but style them as much as possible without affecting the partnership
or the footwork. Everything below the knees is WCS, and anything above is for
you to style. Amplify and style often. Do not wait for the anchor step to style.
Be selfish, be flashy. It is upon the partner to amplify and style to get to
your level. Do not try to be less flashy to try to avoid creating an imbalance;
meet your parter where she is if she is being flashy rather than dumbing down
the dance. That's not what Jack and Jill is about; you are being judged
individually so do your best independently of your partner. Start moving soon.
Do not spend too much time to start the dance. Waiting 16 beats is definitely
too much.

In newcomer division, doing clean basics may win, but in novice it will not. In
novice division you must have clean basics and lots of variety in your movement.
If you see advanced followers, you will see their lats and backs are constantly
rippling.

A straight spine has no styling. Quality motion comes from engaging the upper
body, specially the lats, and improving footwork. Quality of motion is the most
important in competitions. Do not confuse movement across the dance floor with
motion within your own body. Quality motion, not movement, is more effective for
looking good when swing dancing in general.

In the finals context, the criteria changes. Rather than focusing on quality of
movement and variety, the focus is on connection and partnership.

## Patterns

Location and orientation of movement can be described using Cartesian, airplane,
or spherical units:

- XYZ(left and right, up and down, in and out)
- PYR(pitch, yaw, roll)
- RTP(radius, theta, phi)
  - All joints use spherical coordinates (Radius, Theta, Phi). Radius can be a
    percentage, inches, or 0 if it does not make sense. Theta and Phi are in
    degrees.

A body T-posing with an expressionless face represents the neutral position. If
a body part is not described, assume it is in neutral position, meaning all
values and location and orientation values are 0.

All the movable parts:

- head (neck) has X, Z, P, R, W
- shoulder in Y, Z
- chest: X, Z, P, R, W

1. The direction of the movement (or gesture). Use clock time.
2. The part of the body doing the movement:

   - left, right hand
     - pinky
     - ring
     - middle
     - index
     - thumb
   - left, right wrist
   - left, right forearm
   - left, right elbow
   - left, right arm
   - left, right shoulder
   - left, right hip
   - left, right leg
   - left, right knee
   - left, right foreleg
   - left, right ankle
   - left, right foot
     - ball
     - pinky
     - ring
     - middle
     - index
     - thumb
   - lower spine (abdominal and lower-back muscles engage lower spine and hips)
   - thoracic spine (lats engage thoracic spine)
   - neck
   - head (neck muscles engage head)
     - eyes
     - mouth
     - eyebrows
     - forehead

3. The distance of movement:

   - feet:
     - tiny:
     - small:
     - normal: 18in
     - big:
     - huge:
   - shoulders:
     - small: half an inch
     - normal: one inch
     - big: 2 inch
     - huge: 3inc
   - torso:
   - hip
   - knees
   - elbows

4. The level of the movement:
   - arm:
     - highest: 90 deg below parallel
     - high: 45 deg above parallel
     - middle: parallel to floor
     - low: 45 deg below parallel
     - lowest: 90 deg below parallel
   - leg:
     - 90 deg below parallel
     - 45 deg above parallel
     - parallel to floor
     - 45 deg below parallel
     - 90 deg below parallel
5. The duration of the movement (or hold):
   - 1 beat
   - 0.5 beat
   - 0.25 beat
   - 0.125 beat
6. The type of motion in the direction of movement:
   - linear
   - legato
   - staccato
   - impact-rebound

The following animations are not perfect, but they should be conceptually
helpful.

{{% include "./animation-functions.html" %}}

## Open position to hip catch

Start: open position.

Upbeat:

0% - %100:

- left hand:
  - ring RTP(80%, 90, 0)
  - middle (same as ring)
- right hand:
- left, right wrist: same
-
- feet: take a fast, momentous step back with left foot at 7:30, out of the
  slot.
- arm: Do not use left bicep to pull the follower. The arm must be relaxed.
  There must be a lot of tension.
- core: rotate your core clockwise to face 2:00.
- feet: step back with right foot at 7:30 so you are straddling with split
  weight. Resist the urge to settle on right leg.

Downbeat:

- core: face 3:00.

  2.arm: the left arm draws half of counter-clockwise halo over the follower so
  she turns counter-clockwise and faces 3:00 and then release the left-right
  hand connection. At the same time raise your right arm to follower waist level
  and to your shoulder width to catch the follower's hip.

  1.feet: Remain straddled. The follower will go into a straddle position to
  face 3:00.

  1.hands: Catch the follower's waist, not the hip, using left hand. There
  should be no left-right hand connection.

  1.core: Remain facing 3:00.

  1.spacing: you must be in a shadow position such that your right shoulder is
  behind her right shoulder so she can see you with her peripheral vision. Don't
  stand directly behind her.

  1.face: look at the follower because she needs visual cues.
