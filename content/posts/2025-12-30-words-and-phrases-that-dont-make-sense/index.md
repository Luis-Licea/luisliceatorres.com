Some words and phrases have impossible, misleading, or unhelpful meanings when
understood literally.

![Aksyually](./aksyually-cat.webp)

## The verb "to make"

The verb `to make` has the impossible literal meaning `to create matter`. So far
there is no evidence of matter being created. The verb `to make` can be replaced
by other verbs depending on context:

- to make a bed -> to organize a bed
- to make food -> to cook food
- to make a song -> to compose a song
- to make a house -> to build a house

## The adjective "objective"

The adjective `objective` has the impossible literal meaning
`existing independently from the assessments of an entity`. In order for a thing
to exist at all, it must be sensed by an entity such as a camera, a humidity
sensor, an eye, an ear, a finger, etc. It is not possible to sense a stimulus
without assessing it. The camera assesses the colors to form an image, the
humidity sensor assesses the humidity level to create a humidity reading, the
eye assesses the image to send to the brain, the ear assess the sound
frequencies to send to the brain, the finger assesses pressure and temperature
to send to the brain, etc.

- A camera that cannot assess color and brightness will form a black image.
- A humidity sensor that cannot assess humidity will show a humidity level of
  0%.
- An eye that cannot assess what it sees is blind.
- An ear that cannot assess what it hears is deaf.
- A finger that cannot assess what it touches cannot feel.

All things are subjective to the entities that assess them. Nothing is
objective, so the adjective `ojbective` can be replaced by the adjective
`impartial` depending on context:

- the objective facts -> the impartial facts
- an objective judge -> the impartial judge

Reality is everything. This includes fantasy, meat, bones, thoughts, matter,
energy, information. Reality is the information one senses and remembers. All
information that is sensed must be assessed or remembered. If information is not
sensed or remembered, it cannot be assessed. If something cannot be assessed, it
cannot be sensed. If something cannot be sensed, it is not real. Reality does
not exist beyond one's senses or memories. What is not part of reality is not
part of everything, so it cannot be sensed.

## The phrase "force of gravity"

The phrase `force of gravity` is misleading because it suggests that gravity is
a force, but gravity is an acceleration, not a force. The formula for
calculating force is \\(F=ma\\). To calculate the force of a moving object you
need to know the mass of an object \\(m\\) and its acceleration \\(a\\). When an
object is free-falling, the acceleration of gravity is \\(9.8 m/s^2\\).

The phrase `the force of gravity` can be replaced depending on context:

- the force of gravity -> the force of mass times gravity
- the force of gravity -> the acceleration of gravity

## The phrase "volts of current"

The phrase `volts of current` is misleading because it suggests that current is
voltage, but current is amperage, not voltage.

The formula for calculating voltage is Ohm's Law \\(V = I × R\\). To calculate
voltage you need to know the current \\(I\\) and resistance \\(R\\). This means
voltage is not resistance.

The phrase `volts of current` can be replaced depending on context:

- car batteries have 12 volts of current -> car batteries have 12 volts of
  voltage
- that high-voltage wire is dangerous -> that high-current wire is dangerous

## The phrase "grow thicker skin"

The phrase `grow thicker skin` is a metaphor commonly given as advice to those
who have to deal with insufferable people and their unacceptable behavior. This
is bad advice because it suggests that people stop being assholes if you simply
ignore them.

The phrase `grow thicker skin` can be replaced depending on context:

- grow thicker skin -> don't grow thicker skin, grow bigger claws
