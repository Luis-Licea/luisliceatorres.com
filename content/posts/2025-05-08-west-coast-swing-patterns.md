I have been going to the [Bay Area Whip Dance Club] for a few months. Classes
are divided in levels and instructors rotate so they can teach different levels.
So far our instructor for level 1 classes has been [Chuck Anders]. He knows how
to dance Salsa, Bachata, Tango, Polka, Waltz, Rumba, Two Step, West Coast Swing,
and East Coast Swing. If I remember correctly, he said he began dancing when he
was about 14 years old. Luckily Chuck was also my instructor for level 2. I am
repeating level 2. My current instructor is Howard.

I have learned or reviewed the following steps there:

<details>
<summary>Sugar push (AKA Push break)</summary>

- positions:
  - closed position into closed position
  - open position into open position
  - open position into goofy position
  - goofy position into goofy position
  - goofy position into open position
  - parallel position into parallel position
  - parallel position into open position
  - parallel position into goofy position
- awkward positions:
  - starter position to starter position: a starter position should be used to
    transition into another position
  - left hammerlock position: very small steps would be required
  - right hammerlock position: very small steps would be required
- impossible positions:
  - back-to-front position: getting into this position requires a turn
  - left shoulder-lock position: the hand behind the back cannot be used to push
    the follower back
  - right-shoulder lock position: the hand behind the back cannot be used to
    push
- rythm-beat-counts:
  - 1 2 3&4 5&6
- notes: The hand catch happens in steps 1 and 2. Compression happens on 3. The
  push happens on 4. The anchor happens on 5&6.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sugar push with outside turn (AKA Push tuck)</summary>

- positions:
  - open position into open position
  - goofy position into goofy position[^1]
  - parallel position into open position[^1]
  - parallel position into goofy position[^1]
- awkward positions:
  - closed position into any position
  - starter position into any position
- impossible positions:
  - parallel position into parallel position
- rythm-beat-counts:
  - 1 2 3&4 5&6: Step 1 and 2 are forward. Steps 3&4 are a triple step
    backwards. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step.
  - 1 2 3 4 5&6: Step 1 is forward. Step 2 is forward and to the right. Step 3
    is split-weight between both legs, with the left feet pointing to the floor.
    Step 4 is backwards. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step.
- notes: The hand raise happens in steps 1 and 2. Compression happens on 3. The
  push happens on 4. The turn happens between 4 and 5. The anchor happens on
  5&6.

</details>

- Left side pass
- Sugar tuck
- Reverse sugar tuck
- Reverse sugar tuck to close position: put fingertips in between shoulder
  blades as the follower rotates.
- Right side pass (underarm turn)
- Right side pass to close position: put fingertips in between shoulder blades
  as the follower rotates.
- Right side pass with leader turn: drop hand on 4 and turn left on the 5&6
- Closed position to passing tuck turn
- Close position to the left side pass
- Basket whip
- Whip
- Inside turn AKA left side pass with an inside roll (left side pass variation)
- Passing tuck turn (left side pass variation)
- Free spin

## West Coast Swing elements

There are many elements in West Coast Swing dancing:

- Musicality: are the dancers synchronized to the music?
- Rock-and-go: are the dancers able to combine patterns without doing an anchor?
- Repetition: Are the dancers able to take a basic pattern, split it into
  increments, and repeat those increments?
- Tension and compression: Is the leader and the follower connected? Are they
  reacting to each other or dancing independently? Is the leader prepping
  correctly?

## General dance knowledge

- Aim to have fun, stay safe, and dance every song
- An inside turn is a left, counterclockwise turn
- An outside turn is a right, clockwise turn

## Personal advice

From Chuck Anders:

- Do not prepare twice because it confused the follower.
- Move up, down, left and right to use all the slot. It makes the dance look
  good.

From Rick Brunson:

- After finishing a pattern on step 6 or 8, do not rush immediately into step 1
  of the next pattern. There is a whole beat between step 8 and step 1 of the
  next pattern.
- When leading a whip, step back on 1 and pull straight back. Do not begin the
  J-hook prematurely.
- Tension should reach a maximum at the beginning of a pattern, then decrease,
  and then increase back again at the end of the pattern.

From Ray Trusty:

- A prep does not happen on step two, it happens between step 1 and 2, when the
  follower's left foot is floating and pulling on the arm would cause a rotation
  on the follower's right foot. In other words, it is 1-prep-2-3&4 as opposed to
  1-prep-3&4.

From Bob Wilder:

- Move your head and shoulders to indicate where you want the follower to go.
  For example, look over your left shoulder when doing a left-side pass and look
  over your right shoulder when doing a right side pass.
- When leading a whip, on step 1 pull, on step 2 grip the follower's hand and
  post it so it does not move. Let the follower walk into the left hand so the
  momentum causes a clockwise rotation.
- During a sugar tuck, on step 4 keep your left elbow tucked in and relaxed, not
  floating. Imagine you are trying to hold a sheet of paper with your armpit.
- The follower should exert equal and opposite force as the leader to achieve
  good tension and compression.

  For example, if the leader pulls and slowly increases the force from 1lb to
  6lb, then the follower should slowly increase the force with which the pulls
  back to cancel out that force. This causes tension. If the leader pushes and
  slowly increases the force from 1lb to 6lb, then the follower should slowly
  increase the force with which she pushes back to cancel out that force. This
  causes compression. After about 6lb of force is reached, the follower has a
  clear indication to move into the direction she is being pulled or pushed into
  into.

- A good frame consists of having your right hand on the follower's left
  shoulder blade and applying pressure, but an excellent frame requires the
  follower to actively push with her right hand into your left hand to provide
  some resistance. This allows the leader to use his left hand to move the
  follower to the back or to the right, and the right hand to move the follower
  to the front or to the left. This requires the follower to be pressed firmly
  between the left and right hands, which cannot be done without the follower's
  help.

## General West Coast Swing knowledge

- There are 5 pattern types:

  - side passes (6 beats)
  - sugar pushes (6 beats)
  - side pass with a roll (6 beats)
  - wrap in and wrap outs (6 beats)
  - and whips (8 beats)

- Side passes are named from the leader's perspective. For example, in a left
  pass, the follower passes by the leader's left side.

- The forward and backward directions are named from the follower's perspective.
  When a follower and leader move forward, it means the follower is moving
  forwards while the leader is moving backward.

## Musicality

- Music is commonly written in the 4/4 time signature and commonly structured in
  sets of 8 beats
- A major phrase is 32 beats
- A minor phrase is 16 beats (usually) or 8 beats (rarely)
- All ballroom dances except Waltz are written in 4/4 time and can be danced
  using 8 beat patterns:
  - Bachata: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Chacha: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Polka: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Two Step: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Salsa: 8-beat patterns
  - West Coast Swing: primarily 6- and 8-beat patterns, with 10- and 12-beat
    patterns requiring a rock-and-go
  - Waltz is written in 3/4 time signature and has 6-beat patterns

## Rhythm

Not really WCS related, but ...

I have been told contradictory information about Rumba and Waltz:

- Rumba and Waltz have a box step, but the Rumba rhythm is slow, quick, quick,
  while the Waltz rhythm is even because all steps are the same speed
- Rumba and Waltz have the same rhythm: slow, quick, quick

## Rock-and-go (RAG)

A rock-and-go (RAG) combines the last two steps of a pattern with the first two
steps of the next pattern.

A RAG reduces the beat count by 2, e.g:

- two 6 step patterns become 10 counts instead of 12
- an 8 beat whip and a 6 beat basic become 12 counts instead of 14
- an 8 beat whip and an 8 beat whip become 14 counts instead of 16

When leading a rock-and-go, do not let the follower settle back on the anchor
step. The RAG must happen quickly so the anchor step --- which usually happens
in place --- turns into triple step that moves the follower forward:

- In a basic 6 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 5&6 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5&2 or 1 2 3&4 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly so the
  follower does not settle on steps &6, but instead moves forward.
- In a basic 8 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 7&8 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5 6 7&2 or 1 2 3&4 5 6 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly
  so the follower does not settle on steps &8, but instead moves forward.

## Handhold configurations

The palm of the hand can point in four general directions:

- upwards (supination)
- inside (facing the interior)
- downwards (pronation)
- outside (facing the exterior/posterior)

Handhold configurations do not have formal names, but I refer to them like so:

- right to right: handshake handhold
- left to left: scout handshake handhold
- left to right: regular handhold
- right to left: goofy handhold
- left to right and right to left: double handhold
- left to left over right to right: cross-up handhold
- right to right over left to left: cross-down handhold

Examples:

- A double handed sugar tuck into a hammerlock.
- A double handed sugar push inside turn into a sweetheart.
- A crossed-up sugar push inside turn into a cross-down handhold.[^1]
- A crossed-down sugar push outside turn (sugar tuck) into a cross-up
  handhold.[^1]
- A double handed sugar tuck with a left hand release into a goofy handhold.[^1]

## Stance configurations

Stance configurations define how the leader and the follower stand relative to
each other and what handhold configuration they are in.

### Closed position

The leader's right hand is on the follower's back (on the left shoulder blade),
and the follower's left arm rests on the leader's right arm. The leader stands
face-to-face to the follower, sort of like the characters ||.

Reached via:

- Right side pass with inside turn from open|horn position
- Sugar push with inside turn from open position
- Left side pass with inside turn from goofy position

### Starter position

The handwork is identical to the closed position, but the leader stands
perpendicularly to the follower's left side, sort of like the characters \_|.

### Open position

The leader's left hand ring finger and middle finger (pointing to the right) are
held by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at waist level, sort of like
the characters |¯|.

Reached via:

- Right side pass from horn position

### Horn position

Same as open position, but the leader fingers point down. Looks like the sign of
horns.

Reached via:

- Sugar tuck from open position

### Spiderman position

Same as open position, but the leader fingers point up. Looks like spiderman
shooting a spider web.

### Weird position

Same as open position, but the leader fingers point up.

### Goofy position

Mirror image of open position. The leader's right hand ring finger and middle
finger (pointing to the left) are held by the follower's left hand (pointing
down) at waist level, sort of like the characters |\_|.

### Goofy horn position

Mirror image of horn position. Same as a goofy position, but the leader fingers
point down.

### Goofy spiderman position

Mirror image of spiderman position. Same as a goofy position, but the leader
fingers point up.

### Goofy weird position

Mirror image of weird position. Same as a goofy position, but the leader fingers
point to the right.

### Parallel position

A specific double handhold. The leader's left hand ring finger and middle finger
(pointing to the right) are held by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at
waist level, and the leader's right hand ring and middle finger (pointing to the
left) are held by the follower's left hand (pointing down) at waist level sort
of like the characters |=|.

### Back-to-front position

The follower and the leader face in the same direction while the follower stands
in front of the leader while holding the leader's hand in a regular handhold at
waist-level.

Reached via:

- Single arm turn-in from open position

### Left hammerlock position

The leader stands slightly to the left of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's left hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the right hand is pointing down.

Reached via:

- Double arm turn-in from open position

### Right hammerlock position

The leader stands slightly to the right of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's right hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the left hand is pointing down.

### Left shoulder-lock position

A leader hammerlock. A closed position variation. The leader stands face to face
with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the left of the
follower because the leader holds the follower's right hand with the left hand
from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the right hand on
the follower's right shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other pattern.
This position can be reached by the leader by starting from an open position and
performing a right side pass inside turn with a leader clockwise turn without
releasing the follower's hand.

### Right shoulder-lock position

A leader hammerlock. A closed position variation. The leader stands face to face
with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the right of the
follower because the leader holds the follower's left hand with the right hand
from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the left hand on
the follower's left shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other pattern. [^1]

## Preparation variations

A prep is used to rotate the follower clockwise or counter-clockwise.

J-hook

: Used to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into a starter position
during a whip.

Piston

: Used to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into a back-to-front
position during a single-arm turn-in. In a regular handhold, it consists of
pulling the follower's arm on 1 and pushing it on 2.

Left

: Used for the left pass inside turn, right pass inside spin, handshake reverse
whip, and free spin. Forward on 1, prep slightly to the left between 1 and 2,
and rotate counter-clockwise on 3.

Right

: Used for the right pass outside spin. Forward on 1, prep slightly to the right
between 1 and 2, and rotate clockwise on 3.

## Pattern count combinations

Many popular songs are composed such that each phrase is 32 beats. The leader
can use this knowledge to sequence his/her patterns such that they add up to 32
beats, leading to sequences that consistently end on a phrase change.

If you start dancing at the beginning of a phrase change, then you must sequence
your patterns to add up to 32. If started late by two steps, then you sequence
must last 30 beats, etc.

The equations below split up the total number of beats into chunks that can be
translated into specific patterns. For example, the equation \\(32=6+6+6+6+8\\)
could be translated into \\(4\\) basic patterns and \\(1\\) whip.[^2]

I am not sure whether 4-beat or 2-beat patterns exist in West Coast Swing. There
are starter steps that are 4-beats long, but they are only used to start the
dance. Also, 6-beat and 8-beat patterns may be lengthened via styling to make
them 2 beats longer, but I have never heard of a standalone 2-beat pattern.

Some ways to lengthen a pattern by 2 beats are:

- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with a 4-beat, slow, and smooth ronde
- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with 4 small steps, 1-beat each
- Split the 6-beat or the 8-beat pattern into 2-beat increments, and repeat any
  2-beat increment. For example, a 6-beat pattern can be split into 2-beat
  increment like walk-walk triple-step triple-step, and then lengthened by
  2-beats by adding another walk-walk at the beginning or another triple-step
  any time after the initial walk-walk. It is a subtle form of copy-and-paste.
