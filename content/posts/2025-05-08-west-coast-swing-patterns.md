I have been going to the [Bay Area Whip Dance Club] for a few months. Classes
are divided in levels and instructors rotate so they can teach different levels.
So far our instructor for level 1 classes has been [Chuck Anders]. He knows how
to dance Salsa, Bachata, Tango, Polka, Waltz, Rumba, Two Step, West Coast Swing,
and East Coast Swing. If I remember correctly, he said he began dancing when he
was about 14 years old. Luckily Chuck was also my instructor for level 2. I am
repeating level 2. My current instructor is Howard.

I have learned or reviewed the following steps there:

## West Coast Swing elements

There are many elements in West Coast Swing dancing:

- Musicality: are the dancers synchronized to the music?
- Rock-and-go: are the dancers able to combine patterns without doing an anchor?
- Repetition: Are the dancers able to take a basic pattern, split it into
  increments, and repeat those increments?
- Tension and compression: Is the leader and the follower connected? Are they
  reacting to each other or dancing independently? Is the leader prepping
  correctly?

## General dance knowledge

- Aim to have fun, stay safe, and dance every song
- An inside turn is a left, counterclockwise turn
- An outside turn is a right, clockwise turn

## Personal advice

This advice is not verbatim. It is paraphrased in the manner I understood it.

From Chuck Anders:

- Do not prepare twice because it confused the follower.
- Move up, down, left and right to use all the slot. It makes the dance look
  good.

From Rick Brunson:

- After finishing a pattern on step 6 or 8, do not rush immediately into step 1
  of the next pattern. There is a whole beat between step 8 and step 1 of the
  next pattern.
- When leading a whip, step back on 1 and pull straight back. Do not begin the
  J-hook prematurely.
- Tension should reach a maximum at the beginning of a pattern, then decrease,
  and then increase back again at the end of the pattern.

From Ray Trusty:

- A prep does not happen on step two, it happens between step 1 and 2, when the
  follower's left foot is floating and pulling on the arm would cause a rotation
  on the follower's right foot. In other words, it is 1-prep-2-3&4 as opposed to
  1-prep-3&4.
- Do not open up you arms when doing a sugar push. Imagine you are holding a
  piece of paper under each armpit and you do not want the pieces to fall. Only
  open up your arms is when doing a hustle whip to close the space between you
  and the follower.

From Bob Wilder:

- Move your head and shoulders to indicate where you want the follower to go.
  For example, look over your left shoulder when doing a left-side pass and look
  over your right shoulder when doing a right-side pass.
- When leading a whip, on step 1 pull, on step 2 grip the follower's hand and
  post it so it does not move. Let the follower walk into the left hand so the
  momentum causes a clockwise rotation.
- During a sugar tuck, on step 4 keep your left elbow tucked in and relaxed, not
  floating. Imagine you are trying to hold a sheet of paper with your armpit.
- The follower should exert equal and opposite force as the leader to achieve
  good tension and compression.

  For example, if the leader pulls and slowly increases the force from 1lb to
  6lb, then the follower should slowly increase the force with which she pulls
  back to cancel out that force. This causes tension. If the leader pushes and
  slowly increases the force from 1lb to 6lb, then the follower should slowly
  increase the force with which she pushes back to cancel out that force. This
  causes compression. After about 6lb of force is reached, the follower has a
  clear indication to move into the direction she is being pulled or pushed
  into.

- A good frame consists of having your right hand on the follower's left
  shoulder blade and applying pressure, but an excellent frame requires the
  follower to actively push with her right hand into your left hand to provide
  some resistance. This allows the leader to use his left hand to move the
  follower to the back or to the right, and the right hand to move the follower
  to the front or to the left. This requires the follower to be pressed firmly
  between the left and right hands, which cannot be done without the follower's
  help.

## General West Coast Swing knowledge

- There are 5 pattern types:

  - four count triple pairs (4 beats)
  - side passes (6 beats): result in 0.5 turns
  - sugar pushes (6 beats)
  - whips (8 beats)

- Side passes are named from the leader's perspective. For example, in a left
  pass, the follower passes by the leader's left side.

- The forward and backward directions are named from the follower's perspective.
  When a follower and leader move forward, it means the follower is moving
  forwards while the leader is moving backward.

## Musicality

- Music is commonly written in the 4/4 time signature and commonly structured in
  sets of 8 beats
- A major phrase is 32 beats
- A minor phrase is 16 beats (usually) or 8 beats (rarely)
- All ballroom dances except Waltz are written in 4/4 time and can be danced
  using 8 beat patterns:
  - Bachata: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Chacha: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Polka: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Country Two Step: 4- or 8-beat patterns
  - Salsa: 8-beat patterns
  - West Coast Swing: primarily 6- and 8-beat patterns, with 10- and 12-beat
    patterns requiring a rock-and-go
  - Waltz is written in 3/4 time signature and has 6-beat patterns

## Rhythm

Not really WCS related, but ...

I have been told contradictory information about Rumba and Waltz:

- Rumba and Waltz have a box step, but the Rumba rhythm is slow, quick, quick,
  while the Waltz rhythm is even because all steps are the same speed
- Rumba and Waltz have the same rhythm: slow, quick, quick

## Rock-and-go (RAG)

A rock-and-go (RAG) combines the last two steps of a pattern with the first two
steps of the next pattern.

A RAG reduces the beat count by 2, e.g:

- two 6 step patterns become 10 counts instead of 12
- an 8 beat whip and a 6 beat basic become 12 counts instead of 14
- an 8 beat whip and an 8 beat whip become 14 counts instead of 16

When leading a rock-and-go, do not let the follower settle back on the anchor
step. The RAG must happen quickly so the anchor step --- which usually happens
in place --- turns into triple step that moves the follower forward:

- In a basic 6 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 5&6 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5&2 or 1 2 3&4 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly so the
  follower does not settle on steps &6, but instead moves forward.
- In a basic 8 count pattern, the RAG replaces steps 7&8 and turns into the
  count 1 2 3&4 5 6 7&2 or 1 2 3&4 5 6 rock-and-go. The RAG must happen quickly
  so the follower does not settle on steps &8, but instead moves forward.

## Turn variations

### Pass

A traveling turn that uses normal, cross, or hook steps.

### Pirouette

A stationary spin on one leg.

### Pivot turn

A stationary turn in which the weight changes from one foot to the other,
usually for a half-turn.

### Chain turn

A traveling turn in which the weight changes from one foot to the other, usually
for a half-turn.

## Preparation variations

A prep is used to rotate the follower clockwise or counter-clockwise.

### J-hook

Use it to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into a [starter] position
during a whip.

### L-hook

Use it from a [handshake] hold to rotate the follower counter-clockwise 180
degrees into a [closed] position during a whip.

### Piston

Use it from an [open] hold to to rotate the follower clockwise 180 degrees into
a [back-to-front] position during a [single-arm turn-in]. It consists of pulling
the follower's arm on 1 and pushing it on 2.

### Left

Use it from a left-pass inside turn, right-pass inside spin, handshake reverse
whip, or free spin. Forward on 1, prep slightly to the left between 1 and 2, and
rotate counter-clockwise on 3.

### Right

Used it from the right-pass outside spin. Forward on 1, prep slightly to the
right between 1 and 2, and rotate clockwise on 3.

## Handhold configurations

The palm of the hand can point in four general directions:

- upwards (supination)
- inside (facing the interior)
- downwards (pronation)
- outside (facing the exterior/posterior)

Handhold configurations do not have formal names, but I refer to them like so:

- right to right: handshake handhold
- left to left: scout handshake handhold
- left to right: regular handhold
- right to left: goofy handhold
- left to right and right to left: double handhold
- left to left over right to right: cross-up handhold
- right to right over left to left: cross-down handhold

Examples:

- A double handed sugar tuck into a hammerlock.
- A double handed sugar push inside turn into a sweetheart.
- A crossed-up sugar push inside turn into a cross-down handhold.[^1]
- A crossed-down sugar push outside turn (sugar tuck) into a cross-up
  handhold.[^1]
- A double handed sugar tuck with a left hand release into a goofy handhold.[^1]

## Stance configurations

Stance configurations define how the leader and the follower stand relative to
each other and what handhold configuration they are in.

### Closed

The leader's right hand is on the follower's back (on the left shoulder blade),
and the follower's left arm rests on the leader's right arm. The leader stands
face-to-face to the follower, sort of like the characters ||.

Reached via:

- Right-side pass with inside turn from open|horn position
- Sugar push with inside turn from open position
- Left side pass with inside turn from goofy position

### Starter

The handwork is identical to the [closed] position, but the leader stands
perpendicularly to the follower's left side, sort of like the characters \_|.

### Open

The leader's left-hand ring and middle fingers (pointing to the right) are held
by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at waist level, sort of like the
characters |¯|.

Reached via:

- Right-side pass from horn position

#### Horn

The leader's ring and middle fingers point down. The hand looks like the sign of
horns.

Reached via:

- Sugar tuck from open position

#### Spiderman

The leader's ring and middle fingers point up. The hand looks like spiderman
shooting a spider web.

#### Weird

The leader's left-hand ring and middle fingers point to the left.

The leader's right-hand ring and middle fingers point to the right.

### Goofy

This is mirror image of the [open] position. The leader's right-hand ring finger
and middle fingers (pointing to the left) are held by the follower's left hand
(pointing down) at waist level, sort of like the characters |\_|.

#### Goofy horn

This is a mirror image of the [horn] position.

#### Goofy spiderman

This is a mirror image of the [spiderman] position.

#### Goofy weird

This is a mirror image of the [weird] position.

### Handshake

This is the same as the [open] position, but it requires a right-to-right hand
connection instead of a left-to-right hand connection, sort of like the
characters |/|.

#### Handshake horn

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [horn] handhold.

#### Handshake spiderman

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [spiderman] handhold.

#### Handshake weird

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [weird] handhold.

### Scout

This is short for "scout handshake".

This is a mirror image of the [handshake] position because it requires a
left-to-left hand connection instead of a right-to-right hand connection, sort
of like the characters |\\|.

#### Scout horn

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [horn] handhold.

#### Scout spiderman

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [spiderman] handhold.

#### Scout weird

This is the same as the [handshake] position with the [weird] handhold.

### Parallel

A specific double handhold. The leader's left hand ring finger and middle finger
(pointing to the right) are held by the follower's right hand (pointing down) at
waist level, and the leader's right hand ring and middle finger (pointing to the
left) are held by the follower's left hand (pointing down) at waist level sort
of like the characters |=|.

### Back-to-front

The follower and the leader face in the same direction while the follower stands
in front of the leader while holding the leader's hand in a regular handhold at
waist-level.

Reached via:

- Single arm turn-in from open position

### Left hammerlock

The leader stands slightly to the left of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's left hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the right hand is pointing down.

Reached via:

- Double arm turn-in from open position

### Right hammerlock

The leader stands slightly to the right of the follower, maintaining a double
handhold where the leader's hands point down and the follower's right hand is
behind the back pointing outside while the left hand is pointing down.

### Left shoulder-lock

A leader [left hammerlock]. A [closed] position variation. The leader stands
face to face with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the
left of the follower because the leader holds the follower's right hand with the
left hand from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the right
hand on the follower's right shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other
pattern. This position can be reached by the leader by starting from an open
position and performing a right-side pass inside turn with a leader clockwise
turn without releasing the follower's hand.

### Right shoulder-lock

A leader [right hammerlock]. A [closed] position variation. The leader stands
face to face with the follower, but the leader is offset about one foot to the
right of the follower because the leader holds the follower's left hand with the
right hand from a shoulder lock position. The leader places the back of the left
hand on the follower's left shoulder in order to lead a whip or some other
pattern. [^1]

## Pattern count combinations

Many popular songs are composed such that each phrase is 32 beats. The leader
can use this knowledge to sequence his/her patterns such that they add up to 32
beats, leading to sequences that consistently end on a phrase change.

If you start dancing at the beginning of a phrase change, then you must sequence
your patterns to add up to 32. If started late by two steps, then you sequence
must last 30 beats, etc.

The equations below split up the total number of beats into chunks that can be
translated into specific patterns. For example, the equation \\(32=6+6+6+6+8\\)
could be translated into \\(4\\) basic patterns and \\(1\\) whip.[^2]

\end{aligned} \$\$

I am not sure whether 4-beat or 2-beat patterns exist in West Coast Swing. There
are starter steps that are 4-beats long, but they are only used to start the
dance. Also, 6-beat and 8-beat patterns may be lengthened via styling to make
them 2 beats longer, but I have never heard of a standalone 2-beat pattern.

Some ways to lengthen a pattern by 2 beats are:

- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with a 4-beat, slow, and smooth ronde
- Replace the 2-beat anchor step with 4 small steps, 1-beat each
- Split the 6-beat or the 8-beat pattern into 2-beat increments, and repeat any
  2-beat increment. For example, a 6-beat pattern can be split into 2-beat
  increment like walk-walk triple-step triple-step, and then lengthened by
  2-beats by adding another walk-walk at the beginning or another triple-step
  any time after the initial walk-walk. It is a subtle form of copy-and-paste.

## Patterns

### Sugar push

On 1, step back with left foot, on 2, step back with right foot, on 3&4 do a
rock step, and on 5&6 do an anchor step.

#### Sugar push outside pivot turn

Also known as a Sugar Tuck.

On 1 step back, on 2 raise your left hand to the follower's ear level such that
the hands are palm-to-palm. The leader's hand can be pointing straight up at 12
o'clock or angled, pointing at 10 o'clock. The left arm should be kept close to
the body before and after the turn, as if holding a piece of paper under the
armpit, even during the turn. On 3&4 do the rock step while slightly pressing
into the followers raised hand. The follower should press your hand back with
the same amount of force to achieve compression. The turn should begin
immediately on 4 after the compression was created on 3& and movement backwards
has begun. The turn should be completed in one beat so there is time for the
follower to anchor on the 5&6.

#### Sugar push inside pivot turn

Use it from an [open] position. On step 2 raise your left hand and make it
perpendicular to the floor. The hands connection should be palm-to-palm and the
leader's left hand should be pointing at 2 o'clock to indicate the direction of
the pivot turn. On 3&4 generate compression on the 3& and begin the turn on 4 as
you step backwards.

#### Sugar push goofy inside pivot turn

Use it from a [goofy] hold. On step 2 raise your right hand to her face level at
shoulder width with your hand pointing at 2 o'clock. On step 3&4 do compression
on 3& and begin the turn on 4 as you step backwards.

#### Sugar push inside pivot turn into closed position

The same as a [sugar push inside pivot turn] but during step 4, during the turn,
place your right-hand fingers in between the follower shoulder blades. As the
follower rotates, the right hand will be flat against the shoulder blade,
achieving a closed position. Steps 4 5&6 may need to be bigger than usual to
close the gap between you and the follower, otherwise there will be a lot of
space between you both, as if you were in an open position.

#### No-triple sugar tuck

This is a sugar tuck but the 3&4 becomes a 3 and 4 step-tap because the & goes
away.

For the leader's footwork, there is no 3&4, it is only 3 and 4. Step 1 is back,
step 2 is back and to the right. Step 3 is a tap step such that the leg points
to the floor and slightly to the left, but your weight is still on your right
leg from step 2. On step 4, you shift weight onto your left leg that was
pointing to the floor. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step.

Follower's also have the option to perform the no-triple sugar tuck by picking
up one of their legs and using its momentum to propel themselves through the
turn.

#### Single-arm turn-in

The footwork is the same as in a sugar push for the leader. Use it from an
[open] hold. Steps 1 and 2 are for executing a [piston] so the follower will
turn 180 degrees into [back-to-front] position by the end of step 2. On 3& raise
your left arm over her head. On 4 gently push her back in between her shoulder
blades so she knows to walk under the arm. Steps 5&6 are an anchor step.

#### Double-arm turn-in

Same as [single-arm turn-in], but use both hands to do a [left hammerlock]. It
is technically possible to achieve the same by doing a sugar tuck while holding
the follower's left hand, but the correct way is to do a pump prep, which
happens at waist level.

#### Hairbrush

Also known as a head-wrap. It requires a [handshake] or [scout] hold. The
hairbrush can be performed by brining the hand behind the leader's or the
follower's head. It is interchangeable.

#### Sugar tuck chase

Same as a sugar tuck up to but not including step 4. Step 4 should be big and
steps 5&6 should be big steps backward as the tuck turn happens. Usually, the
follower does a turn, but this time the follower will do a 1.5 turn so the
follower is facing backward. The leader should be on the follower's left side,
with the chest pointing to the followers left shoulder, in a [starter] position.
The [starter] position can be followed by a passing tuck!

#### Sugar tuck with spin

Same as a tuck turn, but on step 4 the left hand applies more force so the
follower can do a double spin. Make sure to draw a halo around the follower's
head twice.

### Right-side passes

Also known as a fake whip.

#### Right-side inside pass

Also known as a right-side underarm pass.

The footwork for the leader is the same as in a right-side pass, but from a
[goofy] position. The handwork is the mirrored equivalent from a [left-side
outside pass].

#### Right-side outside chain turn

The footwork is the same as a right-side pass. The handwork is different. On
step 1 do a prep to your right, and don't do a prep for step 2, instead, go
directly into a [J-hook] (rotating clockwise) over her head. You have to be
fast. It takes 2.5 chain turns.

#### Right-side inside pass into parallel position

Use it from an [open] hold. The footwork and most of the handwork is the same as
in a [right-side inside pass]. The follower will turn and her back should be
visible by the end of step 2. Immediately when the follower's back is visible,
slide your hand from her back to her shoulder (3&4), and down the arm (5). You
should have a [parallel] handhold when finishing the anchor step (5&6).

#### Right-side pass into closed position

Use it from an [open] hold. The footwork and most of the handwork is the same as
in a [right-side inside pass]. The follower will turn and her back should be
visible by the end of step 2. Immediately when the follower's back is visible,
place your right-hand fingers in between her shoulder blades. As the follower
rotates, the right hand will be flat against the shoulder blade, achieving a
[closed] position. In steps 3&4, make step 4 bigger. Also make 5&6 bigger than
usual to close the gap between you and the follower, otherwise there will be a
lot of space between you both, as if you were in an [open] position.

#### Right-side inside chain turn

This is a right-side pass with 2.5 turns instead of 1.5 turns. For step 1 give a
prep toward her right ear and immediately begin spinning her counter-clockwise
for 2.5 turns. If you give two preps instead of 1, then the turning will begin
on step 3, and by that time it will be too late. The spinning must begin on step
2 or right before step 3.

There are two preps on steps 1, 2 and they are the same as in the inside turn.

#### Right-side outside leader turn

Use it form an [open] hold. Same as a right-side pass up step 4. On the 5&6, the
leader turns clockwise 1 time to the left of the slot into a [left
shoulder-lock]. The back part of the hand should be firmly placed on the
follower's right shoulder for leading the following step.

#### Short right-side inside turn

Also known as a short right-side pass.

It is like an L in Tetris, whereas a regular right-side pass is the straight
piece in Tetris. Step 1 is back-leftwards, and step two is a cross step. The
movement leftwards happens on number 4. In other words, rather than stepping
into the slot on step 4, you are stepping past the slot. The anchor step can be
a cross or a hook.

### Left-side passes

For the footwork, on 1 step backwards and to the right 45 degrees
counter-clockwise, on step 2 step step backwards and to the right 45 degrees
counter-clockwise. On step 3&4 step back and then front with the left leg, such
that step 4 goes back into the slot at a 45 degree angle. On steps 5&6 do an
anchor step, such that another 45 degrees are added on step 5.

#### Left-side outside pass

Also known as passing tuck.

For the handwork, start in [open] position. Raise your left hand above her head
by step 2 such that her right hand is in front and above her face with about 1
feet of distance. On the 3&4 there should be some compression buildup so the
highest compression happens on step 4 whenever you step into the slot and the
follower begins the turn. By step 6 the hands should go back down to about
waist-level.

#### Free spin

It requires a goofy handhold. The footwork is the same as in a left-side pass.
On step 2 prep to the left and on step 3 throw the hand to the right so the
follower turns counter-clockwise. On 4 step into the slot and catch the
follower's hand. On 5&6 do an anchor step.

#### Roll-in-roll-out

It is similar to a [free spin]. It requires a [goofy] handhold.

#### Left-side goofy inside chain turn into closed position

Prep 1 is on line with the follower's shoulder. Prep 2 is on line with the
follower's face. Step 3&4 is over and behind the followers head such that the
follower's hand gets released on step 4 so your right hand can slide down the
follower's head. On step 4 step back into the slot into closed position.

#### Trusty left-side pass

A pattern that Ray _Trusty_ taught me.

Use it from a [handshake] position. On 1, step back while turning 90 degrees
counter-clockwise. On 2, turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise so the follower is
facing your back. As you perform the half turn, bring your right hand over your
right shoulder and then drop the follower's hand on your shoulder. On 3&4 turn
180 degrees counter-clockwise such that the followers hand slides around the
back of your neck and down your left arm, leaving you in an [open] position.

### Whips

#### Basket whip

Steps 1 thru 4 are same as a right-side pass, but the handwork is different. For
handwork, make an L, such that the left arm points up and the right hand points
to left elbow. It is easier to start this pattern from a [parallel] handhold.

#### Basket whip with an outside turn

It looks like a basket whip with a tuck turn exit. It is the same as a [basket
whip] up to step 4. On step 5 raise the left hand (like in a tuck turn) and
release the right hand, turning the follower from steps 6 thru 8.

#### Basket whip with an spinning anchor

It looks like a basket whip with an accelerated tuck turn exit. It is the same
as a [basket whip] up to step 4. On step 5 raise the left hand on and release
the right hand, turning the follower from step 6 thru 8 with plenty of energy so
she can do a double spin. Make sure to draw a halo around her head twice.

#### Carwash whip

It requires a [goofy] hold or a [parallel] hold. Be in a [goofy] hold by step 4.
Same as whip up to step 4, on 5 don't do a hook step, do a cross step forward.
Then turn counter-clockwise on 6 and do an anchor step 7&8. I think in step 5
you switch hands (from left to right) and bring your right hand to your lower
back, signaling her to go back. On step 5 you can give a strong indication for
the follower to turn clockwise by putting her left hand on your right hip. Her
left hand will collide with your right hip as she steps backwards and your hip
will push her arm clockwise.

#### Decapitate whip

A variation of a reverse whip. It requires a [handshake] hold. Do a [J-hook],
but on step 3 don't release her right hand, go over her head. On step 4, hold or
"cup" her left triceps with your left hand. Use your right hand to turn her back
into the right position.

#### Hustle whip

The footwork is the same as in a whip. For the handwork, a [parallel] handhold
is necessary. Open the arms on 1,2 and close them by 3&. Open the hands on 4,5,
and close them by 6. Post on 6 for the anchor step.

You may do a [carwash whip] exit.

#### Hustle whip inside pass turn into open position

The footwork is the same as a [hustle whip], and the handwork is the same up to
step 4. On step 4, apply tension to lead the follower forwards while raising
your left hand. On 5, raise your left hand as though you were looking at your
clock. Your left hand should be aligned to her nose. On 6, as she is passing by,
draw an counter-clockwise halo around her head and release your right-hand grip.
Then do an anchor position in [open] position.

#### Hustle whip inside pass turn into parallel position

Same as a [hustle whip inside pass turn into open position] up to step 6. On
step 6, immediately when the follower's back becomes visible, slide your fingers
across her back, shoulder, and arm into a [parallel] hold.

#### Hustle whip outside pivot turn

The footwork is the same as a [hustle whip], and the handwork is the same up to
step 4. On step 4, apply tension to lead the follower forwards while raising
your left hand. On 5, raise your left hand as though you were asking a question.
Your left hand should be at her right-ear level and at shoulder-width. On 6, as
she is passing by, draw a clockwise halo over her head without releasing your
right-hand grip. This should put you into a [left hammerlock] position with both
hands in a [weird] position.

#### Reverse whip

From an [open] hold, for steps 1 thru 4, do a right-side pass into [closed]
position. You must not let the follower step back on step 4. You have to pull
her so she steps forward, otherwise she will already be anchored on her right
foot. In other words, on step 4, she must be stepping forward with her right
foot (in between your feet). If she is stepping backward, you are too late (put
fingers in between shoulder blades as she passes). For steps 5 thru 8, continue
the whip as normal.

From a [handshake] hold, for steps 1,2 do a reversed [J-hook] away from your
right hip. On 3, toss her right hand away from your right hip. Use your right
hand to hold her shoulder blade.

#### Pass-through whip

It is similar to a [carwash whip]. It requires a goofy handhold. (do a sugar
push and release left hand. You must use the right hand, like in a free spin):
in steps 1 and 2 raise your hand over her head, in steps 3 and 4 bring your
right hand to your lower back while giving your partner a tug. Step 4 is a
regular whip step, but 5 isn't. Step 5 does not have any rotation. Simply place
your right foot next to your left foot. Step 6 requires your left foot to step
back so you go into the slot. Steps 7&8 you are also stepping backward into the
slot. Then hold your partner's hand with your left hand.

#### Behind-the-back whip

Use it from an [open] position. On step 1 step back and to the left such that
left foot points 90 degrees counter-clockwise. On step 2 close your feet so your
whole body is pointing 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Also, on step 2 grab the
follower's right hand with your right hand and immediately offer your left arm
at either waist level pointing at 8 o'clock or at neck level pointing at 2
o'clock. The 3&4 are not progressive, or they can be progressive but stepping
backwards. Steps 5, 6, 7&8 are normal.

#### Apache whip

Not to be confused with the [behind-the-back whip]. Same on 1 and 2, but on 3
and 4 you put the follower's right hand behind her lower back and grab her right
hand with your right hand into a goofy handshake.
