[Midnight Madness] is a yearly West Coast Swing competition that happens inside
the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport at the [Hyatt Regency DFW
International Airport] hotel.

In order to compete in the competition, you need to buy the following things:

- A weekend pass so you can access the event.
- A Jack-&-Jill, Routine, or Strictly competition pass so you can compete.
- A hotel reservation for Friday night and Saturday night.

The event happens on November 14th through 16th (or a date that falls on a
weekend), but buy the hotel tickets before Oct 20, otherwise all the rooms will
be booked.

Since the event goes from Friday to Sunday, you may want to buy two hotel
nights. One for Friday and another for Saturday.

Ask the hotel what the check-in and check-out times are. If the event ends at
3PM on Sunday and the checkout time is 4PM, you may not checkout in time, which
will mean you will have to pay an extra night.

Whenever you compete for the first time, you do not need to have a [World Swing
Dance Council] competitor ID. You will be given one after you compete.

Read the [driving instructions] so that you do not need to pay for parking. The
short of it is, do not use toll lanes, use the two right-hand "Ticket Only"
lanes to get a ticket, get the ticket from the machine, get the ticket validated
at the hotel, and use the "Cash Only" exit when yo u go through the exit gate.
