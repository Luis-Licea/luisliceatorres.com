Being the lead is hard because it requires being able to quickly remember a
sequence of patterns to dance to. Eventually these patterns become second nature
and memorization is not necessary because new sequences can be created on the
spot, but in the first half year of dancing it is useful to memorize sequences.
Learning sequences is like learning phrases in a new language. Eventually you
will know the language well enough to create unique phrases you never learned
anywhere.

## Basic sequences

These sequences do not add up to 32 beats, so they are better suited for songs
that do not have breaks.

Minus 18 beats (14 beats):

1. sugar push to goofy right-to-left handhold
2. pass-through whip

Minus 2 beats (30 beats):

1. right side pass
2. right side pass to double handhold
3. hustle whip
4. car-wash whip

Plus 10 beats (42 beats):

1. left side pass into handshake
2. reverse whip
3. passing tuck into handshake
4. reverse whip
5. right side pass into handshake
6. reverse whip

## Basic Choreography

This is a basic sequence, or choreography, designed to be danced to songs with
32-beat phrases. Each sequence section contains four 6-beat patterns and one
8-beat pattern, such that each section adds up to 32 beats. The last section
also adds up to 32 beats but it only has 8-beat patterns. Also, each section
gets progressively harder.
