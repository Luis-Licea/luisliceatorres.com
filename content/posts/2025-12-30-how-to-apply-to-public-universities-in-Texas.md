Here is a step-by-step guide to applying for universities in Texas.

## Preparation

If you are still in high-school or in community college, you can take advantage
of this time to build your resume.

- Study for the SAT and take it. The SAT is basically an IQ test that
  universities want you to take. Your application will be seen less favorably if
  you do not submit an SAT score or if the SAT score is low. Find someone at
  your school or university to help you schedule a test.
- Participate in community service. Find someone in your school or university
  that is engaged in volunteer work like cleaning, planting trees, building
  fences, etc. It will be fun. Don't forget the sunscreen.
- Get a part-time job. It may be beneficial to get a school-related job like
  tutor, lab assistant, or student assistant. It will reduce your commute time,
  help you review what you have learned, and socialize with people you probably
  already know.
- Join a club. Some clubs do volunteer work like recycling. Others do leisure
  activities like build robots, read books, or play ping-pong. If I could go
  back in time, I would have played ping pong!
- Apply for scholarships. Whenever you write your submission, express your
  emotions clearly and sincerely. Imagine that an old, sentimental, caring lady
  is reading your submission. I once read scholarship submissions to determine
  the scholarship winners, and I did not penalize harshly on spelling mistakes.
  The winner had to have qualities like being hard-working,
  financially-struggling, dedicated, disadvantaged, etc. I rated tear-jerking
  submissions higher than submissions formatted like research papers.

## Application process

- Determine which public university or college you want to attend, like
  University of Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech.
- Find the application deadline. You will need to gather many documents, which
  may take weeks to gather. The sooner you begin the application, the better.
- Go to <https://www.applytexas.org/> to apply to your public university of
  choice. Depending on your university, you may need to submit the following
  documents:
  - High school transcript
  - SAT report
  - Diploma
  - College transcript
  - Letter(s) of recommendation
  - Proof of meningitis shot

## Tips

- Fill the "request for letter of recommendation form" below, print it out, and
  give it to a teacher, boss, pastor, friend, etc., so that he or she can use it
  to write you a letter of recommendation.

- Apply to more than one university in case you do not get accepted to your top
  choice.
- Apply to more than one program in case the program you applied to is already
  full, otherwise you will not be accepted. Only apply to more than one program
  if you are OK with studying that subject.
- Buy one spare transcript in case you apply for more universities than you
  anticipated.
