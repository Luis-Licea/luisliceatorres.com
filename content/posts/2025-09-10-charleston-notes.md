## General

In Charleston, like in [Lindy Hop], steps 1 and 2 involve rocking backward and
forward, with step 1 being a left-foot step backwards.

## Positions

### Closed position

The position is the same as a [Lindy Hop closed position].

### Left-to-right closed position

The position is the same as a [Lindy Hop left-to-right closed position].

## Patterns

### Basic

Start in a [Lindy Hop closed position]. The footwork for 1 is back with left, 2
is forward with right (rock step) 3 is a kick forward with left, 4 is changing
weight onto your left leg. Notice that there is not a lot of horizontal or
vertical travel for the left foot in steps 3 and 4 because you are kicking
forward and then bringing your foot straight down to the floor. On 4 you are
contracting your right gastrocnemius to impulse you forward and your are using
your left foot to stop the forward momentum. Your right leg should still have
forward momentum from step 4, so 5 is a kick forward with the right foot. On 6
you are contracting your right leg hamstrings as much as possible (bending your
right knee) as your leg travels backwards. 7 is a kick backward with right foot,
8 is step back on right foot. On 8 you are contracting your left gastrocnemius
to impulse you backward and you use your right leg to stop that momentum and
change weight. On 1 your left leg should still have some backwards momentum, so
bring it back such that 1 left leg is behind right leg.

### Kick

Start in a [Lindy Hop left-to-right closed position].

For the footwork, the kicks still happen on 3, on 5, and on 7. Step 1 also feels
like a kick, but it actually lands.

You may choose to cycle steps 3 through 6 to create a progressive move! When you
are done progressing, replace steps 3 with steps 7 to break the cycle.

On 7 you kick with your left leg, making sure to swing it back so you can step
back on 1.

Steps 1 through 3 are the same as in a [basic], but step 4 is different because
your are contracting your right leg calf so you can jump, or move slightly
forward on the 4. On 5 kick forward with the right foot. On 6 contract you left
leg calf so you jump a little bit forward and land on your right foot. On 7 kick
really high with your left leg. On 8 contract your left leg hamstrings. On 1
step back with your back leg as your right leg calf contracts to jump backwards
so you and on your left leg.
