I am a software developer and I work in the aerospace industry doing system
integration and JavaScript back-end development. At work, I
am surrounded by C/C++ developers who hate JavaScript, which gives me a lot of
job stability. :smile:

In the past year, I worked on developing a single page application using
[koa] and [lit], containerizing C/C++ services using [Docker], developing a REST
API using [SQLite] to query a small database, and configuring Linux systems to
run all this software.

Before that, I maintained a website for visualizing simulation data that used
[hdf5] and [numpy] in the back-end for processing large datasets. I also worked
on speeding up [MongoDB] database queries.
