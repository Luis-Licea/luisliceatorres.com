  <p>
      <p>
      You begin with your weight on your left foot.
      In the first 6 steps you are basically making a square.
      It is not shown in this video, but there is a dance brake that consists of
      a right tap and a left tap at the end of the sequence before restarting
      the sequence.

      <p>
      You begin with your weight on your left foot and on the toes of your right
      foot, as though you were tapping the floor.
      You are doing 4 cross steps moving forward.
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>3 steps forward (right, left, right) and kick with your left leg</li>
          <li>3 steps backward (left, right, left) and tap with your right foot (now you should be in the starting position)</li>
          <li>3 steps forward (right, left, right) and kick with your left leg</li>
          <li>3 steps backward (left, right, left) and tap with your right foot
              to the right (this will make it easier to cross your feet in the next
              step)</li>
          <li>left cross and tap</li>
          <li>right cross and tap</li>
          <li>left cross and tap</li>
          <li>right cross and tap</li>
          <li>jazz step while doing a half clockwise turn (right foot crosses left foot, left foot steps back, right foot returns to neutral position)</li>
          <li>jazz step (but no turn)</li>

  <summary>Pitbull, Kesha - Timber</summary>
  <p>
      <p>
      You begin with your weight on your left foot and on the toes of your right
      foot, as though you were tapping the floor, because the first step is a
      forward step.
      <br>
      Notice that the first 8 steps are essentially 4 rock steps. Then you do 4
      triple steps forward beginning with your right foot.
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>right foot steps forward</li>
          <li>left foot steps in place</li>
          <li>right foot steps backwards</li>
          <li>left foot steps in place</li>
          <li>right foot steps forward</li>
          <li>left foot steps in place</li>
          <li>right foot steps backwards</li>
          <li>left foot steps in place</li>
          <li>right foot steps forward and does a triple step</li>
          <li>left foot steps forward and does a triple step</li>
          <li>right foot steps forward and does a triple step</li>
          <li>left foot steps forward and does a triple step</li>
          <li>8 steps back (left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)
              back to starting position, with your weight on both feet</li>
          <li>right hip</li>
          <li>left hip</li>
          <li>do a pivot step to do half a counter-clockwise turn (your weight
              is on your left foot and you turn on the ball of your left foot as
              you take 2 or 4 small steps with your left foot to turn you)</li>
      </ol>
