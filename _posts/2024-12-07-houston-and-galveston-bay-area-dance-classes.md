instructor!

## [Dance Vision Studio â€“ Clear Lake] | ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

For me, each private lesson was about \$120. However, the membership allows you
to attend group classes for free. If you take advantage of every single free
group class and you schedule your private lessons two weeks apart, the average
price per session could be \$30. If you only take private classes, then it is
virtually the same as paying \$120 per class.

Private lessons are done via appointment, and group lessons are spread out
regularly throughout the week.

I would recommend these guys if you are wealthy, or have a very important dance
coming up, like a wedding dance.

## [Fred Astaire] | ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

The place looked like a very elegant establishment, suggesting the private
lessons would be more expensive than in [Dance Vision Studio â€“ Clear Lake]. If
you take advantage of every single free group class, the average price per
session will also drop, but [Fred Astaire] seem to offer fewer group classes
than [Dance Vision Studio â€“ Clear Lake].

I would recommend these guys if you are wealthy, or have a very important dance
coming up, like a wedding dance.
