In Texas, you can register to vote and vote on even years (2020, 2022, 2024,
etc).

You can register to vote at a university, tax office, or department of motor
vehicles (DMV) around September. Volunteers will stand outside the buildings,
giving out voter registration applications. You can also register to vote or
update your information online:
[www.votetexas.gov](https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/update-voter-registration.html).

Be aware that in Texas, you may need to re-register if you do not vote after 4
years or you change your address.

You can find vote centers, sample ballots, and election results on
[www.harrisvotes.com](https://www.harrisvotes.com/).

You may want to add the website to your phone's Home screen or bookmark it so
you will not forget.

Whenever you go to vote, you will need the following things:

- Required: Your driver's license. It is needed to verify your identity.
- Optional: Your voter registration card. It is proof that you are registered to
  vote, so election workers have to let you vote if you have your registration
  card with you.
